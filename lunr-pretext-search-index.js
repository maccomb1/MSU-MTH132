  "title": "Students: How to Use this Book",
  "body": " Students: How to Use this Book  Welcome to MTH 132: Calculus I . This book has been created to guide you through the course, to support your in-class learning, and to give you a resource for independent study and practice.  Structure of the Book  The book is divided into chapters and sections that match the topics of the course. Each section may contain:   Definitions of important concepts.  Theorems that summarize key results.  Examples to illustrate ideas and methods.  Exercises for you to practice and check understanding.  Remarks and alerts that highlight common pitfalls or important insights.   How to Approach Each Section  Here are some suggestions for making the most of each section:   Before class: Skim the definitions, theorems, and examples. Preview the exercises.  During class: Focus on interactive examples and problem-solving activities with your peers and instructor.  After class: Revisit the examples, complete the exercises, and check solutions or hints when provided.   Exercises and Practice  Exercises are a central part of learning calculus. You will find:   Conceptual checks to test your understanding of definitions and theorems.  Computational practice to build fluency with calculations and algebraic techniques.  Applications that connect calculus to real-world situations.   Some exercises will resemble questions on WeBWorK, quizzes, or exams, while others are meant for practice and exploration.  Technology and Tools  This book makes use of graphs, figures, and sometimes interactive elements (such as Desmos activities). A scientific calculator or graphing tool may be helpful, especially when you are first learning new concepts. However, calculators should not become a crutch—the main goal is to understand the ideas and be able to carry out the work by hand. Be aware that calculator use may be restricted or not allowed at all on quizzes and exams, so practicing without a calculator is important preparation.  Connections to Course Materials  This book works alongside other course resources:   D2L for announcements, grades, and course structure.  WeBWorK for online homework practice.  Recitations and weekly reviews for collaborative practice.  Quizzes and exams for formal assessment.   Study Strategies  Some tips for success:   Practice actively: work through examples, don’t just read them.  Collaborate with classmates and discuss your reasoning.  Always show your work and leave answers in exact form when possible.  Interpret results and think about what they mean in context.   Accessibility and Flexibility  This book has been designed with accessibility in mind. Figures include alt text, and the content can be navigated electronically or in print. Use whichever format supports your learning best.  Final Encouragement  Remember: this book is a tool, not just a reference. Stay engaged, practice often, and combine it with the support of your instructors, TAs, and the Math Learning Center. With steady effort, you will succeed in calculus.  "

  "title": "Instructors: How to Use this Book",
  "body": " Instructors: How to Use this Book  This text is both a student resource and a teaching tool for MTH 132: Calculus I . It aligns with course goals, departmental pacing, and assessments such as weekly reviews, quizzes, and exams. The notes below suggest ways to integrate sections, examples, and exercises into your teaching while maintaining consistency across the course.  Structure and Organization  The chapters and sections mirror the course calendar. Within each section you will find:   Definitions and Theorems that frame the main ideas.  Examples that model reasoning, computation, and interpretation.  Exercises spanning conceptual checks, skill practice, and applications.  Remarks and alerts highlighting pitfalls and teaching notes.   Examples and exercises are selected to build toward the techniques and habits needed for quizzes and department-wide exams.  Using the Book in Class  Suggestions for weaving the text into lessons:   Lead with ideas: foreground the definition or theorem and its intuition before procedural steps.  Model reasoning: work through examples that showcase setup, algebra, and interpretation.  Guided practice: assign short in-class problems that mirror examples, leaving space for collaboration.  Bridge to recitation: point out which exercise sets are best suited for group work later in the week.   Technology and Tools  This book includes graphs, figures, and sometimes interactive elements (such as Desmos activities). These can be effective for building intuition, especially early on. Calculators and graphing tools may be used by students when first learning new content, but they should not become a substitute for understanding. Remind students that calculator use is often restricted—or entirely prohibited—on quizzes and exams (policies vary by semester). Encourage them to practice without calculators so they are prepared for assessments.  Supporting Student Learning  Help students get the most out of the text by making expectations explicit:   Ask students to preview definitions and theorems before class.  Encourage them to revisit worked examples after class, comparing their solutions to the text.  Promote group work in recitations and study sessions, emphasizing clear explanation of reasoning.  Stress the importance of exact form, proper notation, and interpretation of results.   Flexibility for Teaching Styles  The text can be used with different instructional approaches:   Lecture-forward: select a small set of worked examples and reserve time for guided practice.  Activity-based: begin with targeted problems, then synthesize with definitions and theorems.  Flipped: assign readings or videos outside class and use class time for problem-solving and Q&A.   Supplement with your own examples or applications while keeping alignment with shared course goals.  Connections to Course Infrastructure  Integrate this book with other course resources:   D2L for announcements, scheduling, and gradebook access.  WeBWorK for online practice aligned with section skills.  Recitations and weekly reviews for structured collaboration.  Departmental quizzes and exams for common assessment standards.   Final Notes  This book provides a shared framework for consistency across all sections of MTH 132 . Adapt examples and presentation to fit your teaching style while keeping notation, core content, and expectations uniform. Model the same habits we want students to adopt: show work clearly, use precise language, and interpret results in context.  "

  "title": "Arithmetic Basics",
  "body": " Arithmetic Basics  Before starting calculus, it is important to be comfortable with basic arithmetic and algebraic rules. Many difficulties students experience in calculus come not from new ideas, but from small algebra mistakes. This section reviews core skills that will be used repeatedly throughout the course.   Signs  We begin with rules involving negative signs. These rules appear constantly when simplifying expressions, computing slopes, and working with limits. Being fluent with sign changes will help prevent many common errors later on.    For any real numbers and ,       Simplify .         Fractions and Rational Expressions  Fractions appear frequently in calculus, especially in limits and derivatives. Careful fraction manipulation is essential for simplifying expressions correctly.    Assume are real numbers with and .       Simplify .         Distributive Law and Common Errors  Many fraction and sign errors come from misusing the distributive law. This law explains how multiplication interacts with addition and subtraction. Understanding when it applies, and when it does not, is critical for algebraic simplification.         Use the distributive law to simplify .         Simplify .    Apply the distributive law to the numerator:      The distributive law does not apply to square roots, powers, or denominators.      Powers and Rational Exponents  Exponent rules allow us to rewrite and simplify expressions efficiently, which is especially important when computing limits and derivatives.    Assume and are real numbers.       Simplify .         Rewrite using a radical.         Rationalizing the Denominator  Finally, let's review rationalizing the denominator. Rationalizing removes square roots from denominators. This technique appears often in limits.          Rationalize .         Rationalize .        "

  "title": "Factoring",
  "body": " Factoring  Factoring is one of the most important algebra skills for calculus. Many problems in limits, derivatives, and integrals require expressions to be simplified before any calculus ideas can be applied. In this section, we review the most common factoring techniques, starting from very basic patterns and gradually building toward the types of expressions that appear in calculus problems.    Factoring Out a Greatest Common Factor  The first and most important factoring technique is factoring out the greatest common factor. If every term in an expression shares a common factor, that factor can be factored out.    If every term of an expression contains a factor , then       Factor .    Both terms share a factor of .       Factor .    Both terms share a factor of .       Factor .    Both terms share a factor of . Factoring out a negative sign is often helpful.      Always check for a greatest common factor first. Many factoring mistakes come from skipping this step.      Difference of Squares  One of the most common factoring patterns is the difference of squares. This pattern appears frequently in limits and rational expressions.         Factor .    Recognize .       Factor .    Rewrite each term as a square.       Simplify for .    Factor the numerator.      The sum of squares does not factor over the real numbers.      Perfect Square Trinomials  Some trinomials arise from squaring a binomial. Recognizing these patterns allows quick factoring.         Factor .    The middle term matches with and .       Factor .          Factoring General Trinomials Using the AC Method  Not all trinomials factor easily by inspection. For expressions of the form , the AC method provides a systematic way to factor. This method is especially useful when the leading coefficient is not equal to 1, and it works equally well when it is.    To factor using the AC method:   Compute the product .  Find two numbers whose product is and whose sum is .  Rewrite the middle term using these two numbers.  Factor by grouping.       Factor using the AC method.    Step 1: Identify , , and .   Step 2: Compute .   Step 3: Find two numbers that multiply to and add to .   Step 4: Rewrite the middle term and factor by grouping.       Factor using the AC method.    Step 1: Identify , , and .   Step 2: Compute .   Step 3: Find two numbers that multiply to and add to .   Step 4: Rewrite the middle term and factor by grouping.      The AC method always works when a trinomial factors over the real numbers. With practice, you may recognize factors quickly, but this method provides a dependable fallback when guessing is difficult.     "

  "title": "Inequalities",
  "body": " Inequalities  Inequalities appear throughout calculus, especially when describing domains, intervals of increase or decrease, and where functions are positive or negative. Unlike equations, inequalities often have many solutions. In this section, we focus on a single systematic approach, the test point method, which works reliably for many types of inequalities.  The key idea behind the test point method is simple. We first determine where an expression could change sign, then test representative points from each interval. This approach emphasizes understanding over memorization and reduces common algebra mistakes.    The Test Point Method: Overview  The test point method is used to solve inequalities of the form , , , or . Instead of solving directly, we analyze where the function is positive or negative.    To solve an inequality using test points:   Rewrite the inequality so that one side is zero.  Find all values of where the expression equals zero or is undefined.  Use these values to divide the number line into intervals.  Choose one test point from each interval.  Determine which intervals satisfy the inequality.      The test point method works best when the expression is factored. This is why factoring is a critical prerequisite for inequalities.      Several Examples  Now let's see this modeled in several examples!   Linear Example   Solve .    Step 1: Identify where the expression equals zero.   Step 2: Use to divide the number line into intervals.  Step 3: Test a point from each interval.   Step 4: Choose the interval where the expression is positive.  The solution is .     Quadratic Example   Solve .    Step 1: Factor the expression.   Step 2: Identify critical points.   Step 3: Test one point in each interval.   Step 4: Include intervals where the expression is zero or negative.  The solution is .    Rational inequalities require special care because the expression may be undefined for certain values of . As we saw in our technique, these values must always be considered when dividing the number line into intervals.   Rational Example   Solve .    Step 1: Rewrite the inequality so it is a single rational expression.   Step 2: Identify where the expression is zero or undefined.   Step 3: Use these values to divide the number line into intervals.  The critical points are , , and .  Step 4: Choose a test point in each interval.   Step 5: Select intervals where the expression is positive.  Since the inequality is strict, points where the expression equals zero are not included.  The solution is   or .     "

In this section, we review the algebraic properties of exponents and develop systematic methods for solving exponential equations.  The focus here is on algebraic techniques. Later in the course, these same ideas will be extended using logarithms and calculus.    Exponential Expressions  An exponential expression is one in which the variable appears in the exponent. For example, and are exponential expressions.   Exponential Function   An exponential function is a function of the form   where and .       Properties of Exponents  Solving exponential equations relies on the fundamental properties of exponents. These rules allow us to rewrite expressions in simpler or more useful forms.    Assume and are real numbers. Then the following properties hold:      These properties do not apply when adding or subtracting exponential terms. For example, .      Changing the Base and the Role of  In algebra, exponential expressions can be written using many different bases. In calculus, however, it is often convenient to rewrite exponentials using base . This is because derivatives and integrals involving have especially simple formulas.  The idea of changing the base allows us to rewrite any exponential expression in terms of a different base. Later, logarithms will give us a systematic way to do this.    Any exponential expression with and can be rewritten using base .  In particular, there exists a real number such that      The value of depends on the base . Later in the course, we will see that , where is the natural logarithm.     Rewrite using base .

Using the change of base idea,      In calculus, derivatives and integrals of are much simpler than those of for other bases. For this reason, exponential models are often rewritten using base before applying calculus techniques.      Solving Exponential Equations with the Same Base  The simplest exponential equations are those in which both sides can be written using the same base. In this case, the exponents can be set equal.

  "title": "Limits from Graphs and Notation",
  "body": " Limits from Graphs and Notation    Understand the intuitive definition of a limit and how to express it using mathematical notation.  Determine limits from tables of values and from the graph of a function.  Recognize when a limit exists, and identify cases where the limit does not exist.  Interpret and compute one-sided limits, and explain how they relate to the existence of two-sided limits.  Understand the meaning of infinite limits and how they relate to vertical asymptotes.  Locate vertical asymptotes and describe a function’s behavior on both sides of each asymptote.     Definition of Limits  The concept of a limit is one of the cornerstones of calculus. Limits allow us to describe precisely what happens to a function’s values as the input approaches a particular number—whether or not the function is even defined at that point. They provide the language for defining continuity, derivatives, and integrals, and they help us capture “approaching” behavior that can’t be expressed by direct substitution alone. Before moving on to more formal ideas, we start with an intuitive definition of a limit.   Limit (intuitive)   Consider a function and numbers , . Then the limit of equals as approaches , in symbols , whenever can be forced arbitrarily close to by making sufficiently close to (but not equal to) . If we cannot make as close to a single value as we would like as approaches , then we say that does not have a limit as approaches .    That is, approximates to within any desired error tolerance, for all values of within some small distance from (but ). One more way to say it: if we make a table of for any sample values of getting closer and closer to (such as , , etc.), then the values of will get as close as we like to (though they might never quite reach ).  Graphically:   Reading a limit from a graph: .        Evaluating Limits  Let's make sure the definition makes sense. Here is a nice first problem to attempt.   Our First Limit   Consider the function   Using a calculator, evaluate the function at the indicated -values and fill in the corresponding entries in the table.    Based on the intuitive limit definition guess the limit value  View the graph of in Desmos . Use words to explain to another student how the table relates to the graph and how the limit can be determined from the graph.       Check Your Answers:         As approaches from either the left or the right, the output values get closer and closer to . Although is undefined (there is a hole in the graph), the limit still exists and equals .   Step by Step Video Solution:        Some limits are easy because we can plug in to get the limiting value , in which case we say is continuous at . Graphically, as in the above figure , this means the curve has no jump or hole at .   A Nice Continuous Example   Evaluate .    Full Written Solution:  Since our function is continuous around (we can draw the parabola without lifting our pencil), we can simply plug into to get the answer .  More Rigorous Solution:  Algebraically, if is close enough to , say for some small (close to ), then which is forced as close as we like to if is small enough to 0 (either positive or negative).    We have seen a few problems where a limit exists, but in fact, as the 2004 movie Mean Girls teaches us, sometimes    The limit does not exist GIF      One way this can occur is if does not approach a single limiting value as approaches . In such cases, we declare that the limit does not exist , and the symbol has no meaning. Now let's see such an example.   When a limit does not exist   Consider the sign function , defined by   Which when graphed looks like:    The sign function .       Determine the limit     Near , the function cannot be forced close to any single output value. That is, , since no matter how close gets to , there are some (namely negative) for which is far from ; and similarly is not , nor , nor any other value. In such cases, it is most appropriate to simply say does not exist.     An important feature of is that it does not depend on , even if is undefined: the limit only notices values of for . As a quick mini example, define for , and , having the graph:   The function for with (a removable discontinuity at ).      Then , since if is close enough to (but unequal to) , then is arbitrarily close to (in fact ). Again, , and is not continuous at .     One-sided Limits  Sometimes, the behavior of a function as you approach a point depends on which direction you come from. For example, a graph might approach one value when moving in from the left, but a completely different value when coming in from the right like in Example .  And so, let's define another type of limit:   One-Sided Limits    One-sided limits (from the right or left) consider only values of on one side of . The limit of equals as approaches from the right, denoted , whenever can be made arbitrarily close to by taking sufficiently close to (but greater than) . The limit from the left, denoted , is defined similarly, except with  less than .     If we have the ordinary limit , then the left and right limits must both have the same value . In the Example above, we have .  However in Example we have, and , even though does not exist.   In fact, we can make our first Theorem from this idea    For a function and real number , the (two-sided) limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. Precisely,   if and only if     A full proof of this theorem requires the formal – definition of a limit and is beyond the scope of this course. You will encounter this level of rigor in MTH 320, where you will learn how to construct proofs of results like this one from first principles.      Infinite Limits  Up to this point, most of the limits we’ve encountered have approached a finite number. However, some functions behave very differently: as you get closer to certain -values, the function’s values grow without bound—either shooting up toward positive infinity or diving down toward negative infinity. In these cases, the function doesn’t have a finite limit, but the way it “blows up” is still predictable.   Infinite Limits and Vertical Asymptotes   We define infinite limits as follows: means that can be made larger than any real number (for example, ) by taking sufficiently close to (but not equal to) .  Similarly means that can be made smaller than any real number (for example, ) by taking sufficiently close to (but not equal to) .  Such behavior signals a vertical asymptote at .     The symbol (and likewise ) has no meaning by itself; it is simply a way of saying that can be made as large as desired.     Consider the function .  Which when graphed looks like:   The graph of .      Answer the following questions.   Using the graph of evaluate and explain your reasoning.  Try now without the graph (using only the equation of ) to evaluate and explain your reasoning.       Looking at the graph , we can notice two key features near :   The graph is in two pieces — one in quadrant II (for ) and one in quadrant I (for ).  Both pieces shoot straight up as they get close to .   This means the function grows beyond any large number we can choose when is close enough to . And so we know     As gets very close to , gets very small — like , , , and so on. Dividing by a very small positive number gives a very large positive number (for example, , , ). In general, we can shorthand this fact as .        True or False: .     False. The two one-sided limits behave differently: but . Because the left and right limits are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist.    Note: Be careful to read problems in this class carefully! Here is problem that is quite similar looking but has a different result.    True or False: has a vertical asymptote at .     True. As approaches from the right, , and as approaches from the left, . This unbounded behavior around means the line is a vertical asymptote.      Locating Vertical Asymptotes  A vertical asymptote occurs at a value of where a function grows without bound (positively or negatively) as approaches that value. This often happens when the function’s formula has a denominator that becomes zero while the numerator stays nonzero, making the function’s value extremely large in magnitude near that point.   How to Locate Vertical Asymptotes  To locate possible vertical asymptotes, we look for values of that make the denominator zero but do not also make the numerator zero. Once we have these candidates, we check the one-sided limits to determine whether the function increases toward or decreases toward on each side.   Now let's see it in action with an example    Consider the function .   Locate the vertical asymptotes for .  For each vertical asymptote, describe the behavior of as approaches from both the left and the right.      Check Your Answers:    The vertical asymptotes are at and .   Here is the function's behavior around each asymptote:     Step by Step Video Solution:        And lastly, a true\/false problem on the same subject    True or False: The function has a vertical asymptote at .    False. Factoring numerator and denominator we get Notice that if we try to naively plug in we get 0 in both the numerator and denominator. From Remark we should suspect that this will not yield a vertical asymptote.  To verify we can plug in numbers close to on either side to see what is happening to .   From this we suspect . And in fact if we simplify and then plug in into the simplified function we get . We will learn in the next section that this will turn out to be a good strategy for evaluating limits. And so, does not yield a vertical asymptote.      Additional Worked-Out Examples  To keep this section at a reasonable length, we include only a few representative examples directly in the text. If you find yourself stuck on a homework problem, or if you are studying before a quiz or exam, additional fully worked-out examples are available via:  Additional Examples for Limits from Graphs and Notation      Practice \/ Study Problems   Some True\/False Problems   Determine whether each statement is true or false and explain your reasoning     True or False: If , then .    False. A limit describes nearby behavior; the function value at the point can differ (or be undefined).      True or False: If and , then .    True. Equality of both one-sided limits guarantees the two-sided limit exists and has that value.      True or False: If , then is undefined.    False. The limit concerns values near ; may be anything (defined or not) without affecting the infinite limit.      True or False: If does not exist, then both and do not exist.    False. One-sided limits may exist but differ; that difference causes the two-sided limit to fail.      True or False: If is a vertical asymptote, then at least one of or is infinite.    True.

Find .    Using the Difference, Constant Multiple, and Power Limit Laws:       Limits by Plugging In  Assuming the Limit Laws and the Basic Limits and , we can prove that most functions are continuous, meaning the limit can be obtained by direct substitution.   A Limit by Substitution   Compute using the Limit Laws.    Step by Step:   Thus the correct limit is obtained simply by substituting .   Note: The Quotient Law requires that the denominator have a non-zero limit. We tentatively proceed with the computation and find the denominator to be 3, which retrospectively justifies the quotient step.     Substituting usually gives the correct limit unless it leads to a meaningless expression such as or (complex values are not considered in this course).   In Section and Section , we will verify that trigonometric functions like and are also continuous when defined, and the same holds for functions like and . Thus, this principle works for pretty much all reasonable functions.    Limits by Canceling Zeros  Some of the most important limits are those where substitution gives a meaningless expression like . To compute these, we must cancel vanishing factors until the expression can be evaluated. This often requires algebraic manipulation such as factoring or multiplying by a conjugate.   Canceling Factors   Evaluate .    Direct substitution gives the meaningless expression , so we must simplify the expression first. Factor numerator and denominator:    Please note that this example is consistent with what we saw in the previous section. Here is a Desmos graph of the function, along with a table of values near .

Using a Conjugate   Evaluate .    Direct substitution gives the meaningless expression , so we must simplify the expression first.  Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate :   Simplify the denominator using the difference of squares:  > Now cancel the common factor :    Again, this algebraic approach is important, but we can also explore the behavior graphically or with tables. View it here: Desmos Graph .       Limits by Cases  As we learned in Section , piecewise functions often require evaluating limits separately from the left and right. One key example of this is the absolute value function , which by its definition is really a piecewise function. Therefore limits involving absolute values often require a case-by-case analysis.   Absolute Value Example   Evaluate .     Check Your Answers:    does not exist, because the left-hand and right-hand limits are different.  Step by Step Video Solution:      Again, this algebraic approach is important, but we can also explore the behavior graphically or with tables. View it here: Desmos Graph .      Limits by Squeezing  Some limits are difficult to evaluate because the function behaves erratically near . For example:   The graph shows the unusual behavior, oscillating faster and faster near because completes infinitely many periods as becomes larger.    The function (solid) squeezed between (dashed).      However, we can still find the limit using the Squeeze Theorem , which applies when is squeezed between two other functions.   Squeeze Theorem   Suppose for all near (except possibly ), and . Then .    Now let's apply the Squeeze Theorem to our example   Squeezing Example   Evaluate .    First note the expression is defined for , which is fine for a limit: we only need values of near (but not equal to) .  Start from the basic bound true for every real :   Substitute (valid when ):   Multiply the entire inequality by . Because for all , the direction of the inequalities is preserved (multiplying by a nonnegative number does not flip signs):   Now add to each part of the inequality. Adding the same quantity to all three parts preserves the inequalities:   Define the “floor” and “ceiling” functions and . Compute their limits using substitution:    Since for all near (but not equal to) we have , and both bounding limits equal , the Squeeze Theorem gives:      Trigonometric functions are especially good candidates for the Squeeze Theorem, since they have natural bounds. For example,   and   These inequalities allow us to evaluate many limits involving trigonometric functions by “squeezing” them between simpler functions.

  "body": " Limits at Infinity: Horizontal Asymptotes    Interpret limits as and graphically as long-term behavior of a function.  Identify horizontal asymptotes using limits at infinity.  Evaluate limits at infinity using dominant term analysis for rational and algebraic functions.  Apply the Squeeze Theorem to evaluate limits at infinity involving bounded functions.  Explain the meaning of a limit at infinity in an applied context.    To understand the behavior of a graph far to the left or far to the right on the -axis, we introduce limits in which becomes arbitrarily large in the positive or negative direction. These limits describe how a function behaves near the ends of its graph.    Let be a function and let be a real number.     means that can be made arbitrarily close to by taking sufficiently large.     means that can be made arbitrarily close to by taking sufficiently negative.      Graphically, if , then the graph of approaches the horizontal line toward the right. This line is called a horizontal asymptote . A similar interpretation applies toward the left when .   Visualizing Limits at Infinity  Limits at infinity are often easiest to understand by looking at graphs. While algebra tells us what happens analytically, graphs help us see how the function behaves for very large values of .   A function approaching the horizontal asymptote as .    Even if the graph crosses the horizontal asymptote many times, the key idea is that the function values remain close to once is sufficiently large.   A function that increases without bound and does not approach a horizontal asymptote.    When or , the graph does not level off, and no horizontal asymptote exists on that end.    Basic Limits at Infinity  The most fundamental limits at infinity come from power functions. If , then   These limits explain why higher powers of dominate lower powers, constants, and reciprocal terms as .    Dominant Terms and Rational Functions  For functions made from sums and quotients of powers of , limits at infinity are determined by the terms with the highest powers. These are called the dominant terms .    Determine whether has a horizontal asymptote.    The dominant term in the numerator is , and the dominant term in the denominator is . For large ,   Since , the graph approaches the horizontal asymptote on both ends.      Find the horizontal asymptote of .    The dominant terms are and , so   The graph approaches the horizontal line on both ends.      Determine the behavior of   as , and decide whether a horizontal asymptote exists.    First rewrite all terms using powers of . In the denominator,   The dominant term in the numerator is , and the dominant term in the denominator is . For large values of , the function behaves like   Simplifying,   Since , we conclude that   Therefore, this function does not have a horizontal asymptote. Instead, the approximation shows that the right end of the graph grows roughly like a line with slope .  The function is not defined for (because of the square roots), so there is no left-end behavior to consider.      Squeeze Theorem at Infinity  The Squeeze Theorem can also be applied to limits at infinity when a function is trapped between two simpler functions.    If for all sufficiently large and   then .      Evaluate .    Since , dividing by gives   Both bounds approach as . By the Squeeze Theorem,       An Application of Limits at Infinity  Limits at infinity are useful whenever a quantity approaches a stable long-term value. In these situations, a horizontal asymptote represents an equilibrium.    The population of a species of fish in a lake years after conservation measures are introduced is modeled by   Evaluate and interpret .    To evaluate the limit, we compare dominant terms in the numerator and denominator.   This means that as time passes, the population approaches fish.  In context, the value represents the long-term sustainable population of the lake. The population increases over time but does not exceed this level, which corresponds to the horizontal asymptote .      The concentration of a medication in a patient’s bloodstream hours after administration is modeled by   Evaluate and interpret .    To evaluate the limit, we compare the dominant terms in the numerator and denominator.  The dominant term in the numerator is , while the dominant term in the denominator is . For large values of ,   Since , we conclude that   This means the concentration approaches over time. In context, this indicates that the medication is gradually eliminated from the bloodstream, and no medication remains in the long term.      Limits at Infinity Beyond Algebraic Functions  Not all limits at infinity can be evaluated using dominant term analysis or algebraic simplification. Some functions require ideas from other areas of mathematics, and others cannot be evaluated until we develop additional calculus tools later in the course.    Consider the function . Evaluate and .    The inverse tangent function has a restricted range:   From trigonometry, as , the angle whose tangent is approaches , and as , it approaches .   This function has two different horizontal asymptotes: to the right and to the left.  Notice that dominant term analysis does not apply here, since is not an algebraic function. Instead, the limits are determined by the trigonometric meaning of the function.     There are many functions whose limits at infinity cannot yet be evaluated with the techniques in this section. For example, consider .  Although both the numerator and denominator grow without bound as , the dominant-term ideas developed here do not apply. Evaluating limits of this type requires additional tools, such as L’Hôpital’s Rule, which will be introduced later in the course.  For now, it is enough to recognize when a limit can be evaluated using algebraic methods and when it cannot.

  "body": " Continuity    Understand the formal definition of continuity at a point and on an interval, and connect it to the intuitive “draw without lifting your pencil” idea.  Identify and classify discontinuities as removable, jump, infinite, or essential, based on their definitions and interpret their graphical representations.  Test piecewise functions for continuity at transition points and determine parameter values that make them continuous.  Determine the domain of continuity for functions involving rational expressions, square roots, and other common operations.  Apply the Composition Law to evaluate limits of compositions of continuous functions.     Definition and Overview  One of the most basic features of a function is whether it is continuous . Roughly, this means that a small change in always leads to a fairly small change in , without instantaneous jumps. In physical terms, the position of a particle moving in space is continuous, but the position displayed in a video could have a gap, making the position function jump discontinuously.    A function is continuous at whenever    Graphically, a function is continuous if the curve passes through the point without any jumps or holes. This matches the intuitive idea of continuity — you can draw the graph near without lifting your pencil.  We say is continuous on an interval whenever it is continuous at each point of the interval. For endpoints of a closed interval , we require one-sided limits: and .    Removable Discontinuity    A function has a removable discontinuity at if exists but is either undefined or does not equal that limit.   Graphically, a removable discontinuity appears as a hole in the curve at . The discontinuity is \"removable\" because we can redefine to equal the limit, making the function continuous at .   Two examples of removable discontinuities: one where is undefined, and one where the value does not equal the limit.          Revisit . Verify that the function has a removable discontinuity at .    At , both the numerator and denominator vanish, giving us the meaningless expression so the function is undefined. However, we can verify again that exists (is equal to ). This matches the definition of a removable discontinuity. Moreover we can view the picture in to see visually the hole in the graph at .      Revisit . Verify that this function has a removable discontinuity at .    At , both the numerator and denominator vanish, giving the undefined form . However, multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate simplifies the expression to , which is continuous everywhere. Taking the limit, we find Thus, although is undefined, the limit exists and equals 6. This is exactly the definition of a removable discontinuity, and the graph shows a “hole” at .      Jump Discontinuity    A function has a jump discontinuity at if the left and right limits exist but are unequal:    Graphically, a jump discontinuity appears as a sudden jump in the curve at .   A jump discontinuity where left and right limits differ.       Revisit . Verify that the function has a jump discontinuity at .    Notice that . For , the absolute value simplifies to , so . For , we instead get , so .  Thus the left-hand limit is while the right-hand limit is Since these limits are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist. This confirms that has a jump discontinuity at .      Infinite Discontinuity    A function has an infinite discontinuity at if one or both one-sided limits diverge to infinity:    Graphically, an infinite discontinuity appears as a vertical asymptote in the curve at .   A discontinuity caused by a vertical asymptote.       Revisit . Verify that the function has an infinite discontinuity at .    The function is undefined at . As , , so . As , , so . In both directions the function grows beyond all bounds, so   Thus, has an infinite discontinuity at . Graphically, this appears as a vertical asymptote along the -axis.      Essential Discontinuity    A function has an essential discontinuity at if one or both one-sided limits fail to exist in any sense.   Graphically, an essential discontinuity quite often appears as a wild oscillation in the curve at .   An essential discontinuity where one-sided limits fail to exist.       Consider the function . Show that has an essential discontinuity at .    The function is not defined at . As approaches 0, the reciprocal grows without bound in magnitude. Since oscillates between and for all values of , the outputs continue to oscillate rapidly between and as .  No single limiting value can be assigned: the left-hand and right-hand limits both fail to exist because of these wild oscillations. By definition, this is an essential discontinuity at .  Graphically, the curve appears to “wiggle infinitely fast” near the vertical line , matching the intuition for an essential discontinuity.     In this course, students are not expected to determine whether a function has an essential discontinuity by analyzing its formula alone. Identifying essential discontinuities rigorously from an equation requires tools from real analysis, which are developed in courses such as MTH 320.  For MTH 132, essential discontinuities are included primarily so that you recognize that they exist and can identify them from a graph . You will not be asked to classify or prove essential discontinuities using algebraic or analytic arguments on quizzes or exams.     Continuity of Piecewise Functions  For a function defined by cases, whose graph consists of several continuous pieces, the function is continuous provided the pieces join together at the transition points where the cases meet.    Consider the piecewise function   Find the value of that makes continuous at .    To check continuity at , we need three things: (1) the function is defined at , (2) the limit exists, and (3) the limit equals .  First, , so the function is defined at for any value of .  Next, compute the one-sided limits. For , we use the left-hand piece : For , we use the right-hand piece :   For the limit to exist, these must be equal: Solving gives , so .  Finally, with we have , which matches the limit. Therefore is continuous at when .      Suppose a weight is winched from the ground at a constant speed for 8 seconds, is dropped, and lands 2 seconds later.  Then the height in feet at time seconds is given by   How fast should the winch haul upward?    The function is defined in two pieces. The first piece, , describes the weight being lifted upward from the ground at a constant speed feet per second, for times .  The second piece, , describes what happens once the weight is released at . Recall that a dropped object falls feet in seconds. Since the fall begins at , we measure the time of fall as . Thus, after seconds of falling, the weight will have fallen feet. The weight was released from a height of 64 feet, so its position after seconds is given by .  To find the correct speed of the winch, we need the two pieces of the function to “meet up” at . That means the height from the lifting phase at must equal the height from the falling phase at . Using the lifting phase we get . Using the falling phase we get . Setting these equal gives   Finally, let us check continuity explicitly at . From the left-hand side, From the right-hand side, Since both one-sided limits equal 64, the two-sided limit exists and equals 64. Moreover, this matches the value of the function at that point, . Therefore the function is continuous at .      Domain of Continuity  Almost all functions defined by formulas are continuous, except at points where they are undefined. This follows from our methods for computing limits.    Find where is continuous.    First, let’s analyze the rational factor outside the square root. Using the Limit Laws from repeatedly, we compute:   as long as the denominator does not vanish. In other words, this step is valid provided .  Next, consider the square root factor. By the Limit Laws,   but this only makes sense when the inside of the square root is nonnegative. Thus we require , or equivalently (strict inequality if we want the square root defined for all nearby ).  We now combine the two factors to evaluate the overall limit:   By the Limit Laws, the limit of a product equals the product of the limits, provided each individual limit exists. So we can separate this into two pieces:   We already computed each factor individually: the rational expression simplifies to (valid when ), and the square root tends to (valid when ).   Thus, whenever both conditions ( and ) are satisfied, this is the value of the limit.  Let's now examine the exceptional cases:     : The square root is undefined, so the function is not continuous.     : The square root is defined, and since this is the left endpoint of the domain, continuity only requires the right-hand limit. Indeed, , so the function is continuous at .     : The denominator vanishes, and the graph has a vertical asymptote. This corresponds to an infinite discontinuity (type (iv)).    Putting this all together, we conclude that is continuous everywhere in its domain, which consists of the intervals   The graph below illustrates this behavior:    Graph of showing its domain of continuity.

  "title": "Intermediate Value Theorem",
  "body": " Intermediate Value Theorem    State the Intermediate Value Theorem and explain in your own words what it guarantees about continuous functions.  Apply the IVT to demonstrate that an equation has a solution within a given interval, even without finding the exact solution.  Recognize situations where the IVT cannot be applied, such as when a function is not continuous on the entire interval.  Interpret the IVT graphically and numerically, understanding how it ensures intermediate values are attained.    One of the most important applications of continuity is the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT). This theorem provides a way to guarantee the existence of solutions to equations, even when we cannot solve them exactly. It also explains why continuous functions must pass through all intermediate values between two function outputs.   Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)   If is continuous for in the interval , and is between and , meaning either or , then there is at least one (but possibly more) value of Here lies in the open interval , between and but excluding both endpoints: . such that .     Illustration of the Intermediate Value Theorem: a continuous function on , a value between and , and at least one point with .         This says that as the function value goes continuously from to , perhaps rising and falling many times, it must pass through every value between and .   Let's see how the theorem works in practice.   Applying the IVT   Let . Show that there exists a number such that .    The function is a polynomial, hence continuous on every interval, in particular on .  Evaluate the endpoints: and . Thus , so the value lies between and .  By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists such that . So although we do not know the exact value of we know that is must exist and what interval it is in.    In the previous example, everything worked out neatly: the function was continuous on the interval and the target value fell between the two endpoint values. But if continuity is broken, the Intermediate Value Theorem no longer applies. The next example illustrates this.    Consider the function:    Does take on the value somewhere in the interval ?  Can the Intermediate Value Theorem be applied to justify your answer to (a)? Why or why not?       Solve :    Since , the equation has no solution in . So No , does not take the value on .     No — the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) requires continuity on a closed interval. The function is not continuous on because it has a vertical asymptote at (the denominator is zero there).  So even though and , and the value lies between and , because is not continuous on the entire interval the Intermediate Value Theorem cannot be applied.      Finally, let's look at a famous equation where the IVT guarantees the existence of a solution, even though we cannot solve it with algebra alone.    Show that there exists a solution to the equation .    There is no simple algebraic way to solve directly. Instead, define a new function   Then solving is equivalent to finding a root of , that is, some with .  First check some values of on the interval :   .  .   Thus, and , so the function values change sign between and .  Next, recall that is continuous: the cosine function is continuous everywhere, and is also continuous, so their difference is continuous.  By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if a continuous function takes on values of opposite signs at the endpoints of an interval, then it must equal zero for some number between those endpoints. Therefore, there exists such that .  In other words, there is some number with . (In fact, numerically , but the IVT only guarantees existence, not the exact value.)    The Intermediate Value Theorem is powerful because it guarantees the existence of solutions even when they cannot be computed exactly. Without relying on advanced tools or calculators, it allows us to conclude that roots and crossing points must lie within specific intervals. This gives us both confidence and direction when working with problems that might otherwise seem inaccessible.

  "body": " Introduction and Motivation for Derivatives    Compute the average rate of change of a function on an interval and interpret it as the slope of a secant line.  Describe instantaneous velocity as the limit of average velocities over shrinking time intervals.  Interpret instantaneous rate of change geometrically as the slope of a tangent line.  Use tables, graphs, and nearby average rates of change to estimate an instantaneous rate of change.    Derivatives begin with a simple question: how fast is something changing right now ? You already know how to compute an average rate of change over a time interval. The derivative is what happens when we shrink that interval smaller and smaller and study the limiting behavior of these average rates.  Throughout this section, the same expression will appear in multiple contexts: average velocity, slopes of secant lines, and instantaneous rate of change. This expression is called the difference quotient .   Average and Instantaneous Velocity  Suppose a particle moves along a line so that at time it is at position . We begin by defining the average velocity over a time interval.    Let denote the position of an object at time . The average velocity of the object on the time interval is      The average velocity represents the total change in position divided by the total change in time. Geometrically, it is the slope of the secant line connecting and on the graph of .   Instantaneous velocity cannot be measured over a single moment in time. Instead, it is defined as a limit of average velocities over shrinking time intervals.    Let denote the position of an object at time . The instantaneous velocity at time is   provided this limit exists. More generally, if represents a quantity other than position, this same limit represents the instantaneous rate of change of that quantity with respect to time at .     Velocity may be positive or negative depending on direction of motion. The speed of an object is the absolute value of its velocity.     A stone dropped from a bridge has position (in feet below the bridge) approximately after seconds.     Compute the average velocity on using .    Using with and ,   So the average velocity on is ft\/sec.      Use the table of velocities below to estimate the instantaneous velocity at .     As gets smaller, the average velocities get closer to . So a reasonable estimate for the instantaneous velocity at is ft\/sec.      Compute the instantaneous velocity at using .    By , the instantaneous velocity at is   Since , we compute   As we take smaller and smaller, the error term approaches zero, and the average velocity approaches the limiting value , which by definition is the instantaneous velocity. Therefore, the instantaneous velocity at is ft\/sec.       Slopes of Secant Lines and Slopes of Tangent Lines  We have described velocity on several conceptual levels. It can be understood as a physical quantity describing motion, a numerical approximation obtained from average rates of change, and an algebraic computation using limits. Velocity also has a geometric interpretation in terms of the graph , where it corresponds to the slope of the graph at a given time.  A secant line is a line that passes through two distinct points on the graph. It cuts across the curve and represents how the function changes between two different input values. When these two points are far apart, the secant line gives a coarse description of the function’s behavior over an interval.    A secant line connecting the points and , representing the average rate of change of on the interval .       Let be a function and let . The slope of the secant line to between and is      The slope of the secant line is the slope of the line through the points and . Algebraically, it is the same formula used for the average rate of change.   A tangent line , on the other hand, touches the graph at a single point and matches the direction of the curve at that point. It represents the function’s behavior at a specific input value and provides a local, instantaneous description of change.    A tangent line through the point , representing the instantaneous rate of change of at .     As the second point used to define a secant line moves closer and closer to the first, the secant line approaches the tangent line. This idea leads directly to the following definitions.     As two points on the curve move closer together, the secant line determined by those points approaches the tangent line at a single point.   Animated graph of a smooth curve with two points marked on it. A secant line passes through the two points. As the points move closer together along the curve, the secant line rotates and converges to the tangent line at that point, illustrating how the tangent line arises as a limit of secant lines.        Let be a function and let be a point in its domain. The slope of the tangent line to at is   provided this limit exists. Equivalently, the slope of the tangent line can be written as   provided this limit exists.     The limit as is the more common definition in practice, because it is often algebraically convenient to evaluate limits at after simplifying the expression.    The slope of the tangent line gives the slope of the line that best approximates the graph of near . This is the same limit used to define instantaneous velocity, which explains why this limit describes both slopes of curves and rates of change.    A Trigonometric Model and Estimating Rates   We model average daily temperature through the year by the sinusoidal function:   Using this model we found that   Using this table, estimate how quickly the weather is warming at (Apr 10), in degrees per day.    To estimate how quickly the temperature is changing at , we approximate the instantaneous rate of change using average rates of change from nearby data values in the table.  First, compute the average rate of change from to .   Next, compute the average rate of change from to .   These two values represent average rates of change on either side of . Since they are close in value, we use their average to estimate the instantaneous rate of change at .   Therefore, the temperature is increasing at approximately degrees Fahrenheit per day on April 10.    In the next sections, we will turn these ideas into a precise definition and develop tools for computing instantaneous rates of change efficiently.   "

Rewrite the derivative definition using either or .  Define the derivative function and interpret it as a new function.  Recognize common situations where a derivative fails to exist (corners, cusps, vertical tangents, discontinuities).     Definition of the Derivative  In earlier sections, we saw that instantaneous velocity can be obtained as a limit of average velocities over shorter and shorter time increments. Likewise, the slope of a tangent line can be obtained as a limit of secant slopes as the secant point moves closer and closer to the point of tangency.  Both ideas measure an instantaneous rate of change. For a general function , we define its instantaneous rate of change at using the following limit.   Derivative at a Point   The derivative of a function at , denoted , is defined by   provided the limit exists.    Here is the change in the output, and is the change in the input. The quotient is the average rate of change over the interval from to , and the derivative is the limit as the increment shrinks to 0.  Another common form comes from substituting (so that ):   Geometrically, if exists, then it is the slope of the tangent line to at the point . The tangent line has equation    If the limit defining exists, we say is differentiable at . If the limit does not exist, then is undefined and is not differentiable at .     Computing Derivatives from the Definition  A derivative is always a limit of a difference quotient, so direct substitution usually produces the meaningless expression . The goal is to simplify the difference quotient until the limit can be evaluated.   A Rational Example   Find for .    Step by Step:      A Radical Example   Find for .    We multiply by the conjugate to eliminate the radical in the numerator.      A Cube Root Example   Find for .    Here we use the identity .   This example is a good preview of why we will soon develop derivative rules: computing derivatives from the limit definition can become algebraically heavy.      The Derivative Function  The derivative at a point is a single number. But we can compute the derivative for many input values, producing a new function.   Derivative Function   The derivative function of , denoted , is defined by   for all where this limit exists.     Computing a Derivative Function   Let . Find .    Step by Step:       When the Derivative Fails to Exist  Even if a function is defined at a point, the derivative may fail to exist there. Graphically, this happens when the curve does not have a single well-defined tangent line.  Common ways differentiability can fail include:   Corner: the left-hand and right-hand slopes are finite but different.  Cusp: the left-hand and right-hand slopes become infinite with opposite signs.  Vertical tangent: slopes become infinite (unbounded) with the same sign.  Discontinuity: if a function is not continuous at a point, then it cannot be differentiable there.    One-Sided Derivatives Agree   Let   Show that exists and find its value.    We compute the right-hand and left-hand derivatives.    Since the one-sided derivatives agree, .     A Corner   Consider . Explain why does not exist.

  "title": "Basic Differentiation Rules",
  "body": " Basic Differentiation Rules    Interpret derivative notation in both Newton form and Leibniz form .  Use basic derivative formulas to differentiate power functions and constants.  Apply the sum, constant multiple, product, and quotient rules to compute derivatives algebraically.  Interpret higher derivatives in an applied context (velocity and acceleration).    So far, we have seen how real-world rate-of-change problems and geometric tangent-line problems lead to derivatives. In this section, we focus on computing derivatives efficiently by using algebraic rules, so we do not need to return to the limit definition every time.   Notation for the Derivative  The derivative of a function can be written in several equivalent ways. In Newton notation we write . In Leibniz notation we write , which is meant to remind us of the definition of the derivative as a limit of difference quotients:   Here is a change in the input, and is the corresponding change in the output: and . The notation does not literally mean “a quotient of two tiny numbers.” It is a single symbol that represents a limit.  For example, if , then the derivative formula can be written as   To emphasize the difference between “the derivative function” and “the derivative at a point,” we write . You may also see the notation for the derivative of , so that .    Basic Derivatives  The strategy is the same as earlier limit techniques: we establish derivatives of basic functions, then build more complicated derivatives from those. The most important basic formulas are the following.   Derivatives of Constant and Linear Functions    If is a constant function, then .  If , then .     We use the limit definition of the derivative.  First, suppose , where is a constant. By definition,   Since and , the numerator is zero.   Therefore, the derivative of a constant function is zero.  Next, suppose . Using the limit definition,   Simplifying the numerator gives   Therefore, the derivative of is equal to .     The Power Rule   Let be any real number for which is defined. If , then     We begin with a geometric intuition. For the function , increasing by a small amount produces a change in area that is approximately .    A geometric illustration of the change in area when a square of side length is increased by a small amount . The added strips show how the area grows approximately like .   A square with side length x and area x squared is shown. Light shaded strips of width Delta x are added along the top and right sides, representing the increase in area when x is increased by Delta x. The diagram visually illustrates how the change in area is approximately proportional to 2x times Delta x.     This suggests that   A similar idea applies to volume. For , the change in volume due to a small increase is approximately ,    A geometric illustration of the change in volume when a cube of side length is increased by a small amount . The added slabs show how the volume grows approximately like .   A cube with side length x and volume x cubed is shown. Light shaded slabs of thickness Delta x are added to the top, right, and back faces of the cube, representing the increase in volume when x is increased by Delta x. The diagram illustrates that the dominant contribution to the change in volume is proportional to 3x squared times Delta x.     suggesting that .  More generally, for the growth of an -dimensional cube with side length , this geometric reasoning suggests that . While this intuition cannot be visualized for higher dimensions, it motivates the algebraic proof that follows.  We now prove the Power Rule rigorously using the limit definition of the derivative. The constant and linear cases were proved earlier. We focus on the case .  The proof proceeds in stages, beginning with whole number powers. Throughout, we repeatedly use the identity   which holds for all positive integers .   Step 1: Positive integer powers. Let be a positive integer. Using the limit definition of the derivative,   Apply the factorization identity with and .   Cancel the factor of to obtain   Taking the limit as gives   Therefore, for positive integers ,    Step 2: Negative integer powers. Let , where is a positive integer. Then . In the derivative limit, we combine fractions and apply the same factorization identity with and .  After simplification, the resulting expression reduces to   Thus, the Power Rule holds for negative integers as well.   Step 3: Rational powers. Let , where is a positive integer and is any integer. Then   In the derivative limit, the numerator has the form . As in earlier work with cube roots, we multiply the numerator and denominator by   where and . This eliminates the radicals and produces the numerator   which we have already handled. Simplifying the resulting limit again yields .  Therefore, the Power Rule holds for all rational exponents.  The formula is also valid for irrational exponents such as , but proving this rigorously requires more advanced theory.      Compute each derivative:      .    Apply the power rule with .        .    First rewrite the cube root using exponent notation, then apply the power rule.        .    Rewrite the reciprocal using a negative exponent, then apply the power rule.        Derivative Rules  Once we know the derivatives of basic functions, we can differentiate combinations of functions using rules. Suppose and are differentiable at .      Sum Rule:  .   Difference Rule:  .   Constant Multiple Rule:  for any constant .   Product Rule:  .   Quotient Rule:  , where .     A proof of the Derivative Sum Rule is presented in the video below.    A proof of the Product Rule is presented in the following video.    Proofs of additional derivative rules can be found online. Your instructor would love to talk about this in office hours, and also you may want to consider a math major\/minor. These topics are covered in more detail in MTH 320.     Warning: the derivative of a product is not the product of derivatives. In general, .     Use the definition of the derivative to justify the Sum Rule: .    Start with the limit definition and separate the difference quotient into two pieces:   This step uses limit laws for sums.    The Product Rule can be motivated geometrically using an area model for a rectangle with side lengths and .   A geometric picture behind the Product Rule: the change in area comes from two edge strips plus a tiny corner piece.     When is small, the changes and are small as well. The change in area is . After dividing by and taking , the term involving vanishes, producing .     Derivative Computations    Compute .    Write and use the power rule.       Compute .     is a constant, so its derivative is .      Let . Compute .    Use the Product Rule with and .   (Optional) You can also expand first and then differentiate term-by-term. Both approaches agree.      Differentiate .    First rewrite the denominator: . Then , so   You could also use the Quotient Rule directly; both methods produce equivalent results.      A block of ice has length cm, width cm, and height cm. Its length and width are decreasing at cm\/hr, and its height is decreasing at cm\/hr. How fast is the volume decreasing at that instant?    The volume is , and all three dimensions depend on time . Differentiate using the Product Rule (applied twice):   At the instant described: , , , , , (cm\/hr).   The volume is decreasing at cm 3 \/hr.      Higher Derivatives  Because the derivative of a function is itself a function, we can differentiate again. The second derivative of is denoted , and in Leibniz notation it is written :   If represents position as a function of time, then is velocity and is acceleration.    A stone falls feet in seconds. Compute , , and interpret them.    Differentiate repeatedly using the power rule:   Here is velocity (ft\/sec), increasing with time. The constant is acceleration (ft\/sec 2 ), and means the acceleration is not changing.     "

Key Idea: Implicit Differentiation   Implicit Differentiation    Implicit differentiation consists of differentiating both sides of an equation with respect to and then solving the resulting equation for .  In the examples and exercises of this section, it is assumed that the given equation determines implicitly as a differentiable function of , so that implicit differentiation applies.     The key feature is that depends on , even if the equation does not explicitly solve for . So whenever you differentiate an expression containing , you must use the Chain Rule and include a factor of .     Straightforward Examples   Implicit Differentiation with a Logarithm   Given the equation , find using implicit differentiation.    Differentiate both sides with respect to . The left side requires the Product Rule on and the Chain Rule on and .   Now solve for by collecting terms with .

At what point in the first quadrant is the tangent line to this curve horizontal?    Differentiate both sides with respect to . On the right side, use the Product Rule on .   Solve for .   A horizontal tangent occurs when , which requires the numerator to be zero (and the denominator nonzero):   Substitute into the original equation .   In the first quadrant, , so divide by :   Then .

Tangent Line from an Implicit Equation   Find an equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point .    Differentiate both sides with respect to . Use the Product Rule on both sides.

Differentiate implicitly:   At a point on the curve, the slope is . The tangent line is .  Find the intercepts. The -intercept occurs when :   So the -intercept is . The -intercept occurs when :   Thus the sum of intercepts is .  Since lies on , we have , so . Therefore the sum of the intercepts is always .

Points on the -axis have . Substitute into the equation:   So the ellipse crosses the -axis at and .  Differentiate implicitly:   At points on the -axis, , so   In particular, the slope at both and is 2, so the tangent lines are parallel.     When Do We Need Implicit Differentiation?   Explain how to determine when implicit differentiation is needed to find , as opposed to using the standard differentiation methods covered earlier. Provide an example where implicit differentiation is required and one where it is not.    Implicit differentiation is needed when is not given explicitly as a function of , or when the equation mixes and in a way that makes solving for difficult or undesirable. In these cases, we treat as a function of and differentiate both sides with respect to , remembering that derivatives of expressions involving must include a factor of .  For example, the equation defines a circle. Solving for gives , which is possible but splits into two functions. Implicit differentiation gives , so , which works on the whole circle (except where ).  On the other hand, if is already given explicitly, such as , then standard differentiation rules apply directly and there is no need for implicit differentiation. In this example, the Chain Rule gives .     Geometric Meaning of   A student uses implicit differentiation on a curve and finds that at the point . Explain the geometric meaning of this result as it relates to the graph of the curve.    The derivative at means that the tangent line to the curve at that point has slope 5. Geometrically, the curve is increasing at , and near that point the graph rises about 5 units vertically for every 1 unit horizontally (using the usual interpretation of slope).  Equivalently, if we zoom in close enough around , the curve looks nearly like the tangent line, and that tangent line has equation      "

  "body": " Motion in Physics    Translate between physical, geometric, numerical, and algebraic meanings of the derivative.  Interpret motion quantities , , , and using derivatives.  Use graphs and tables to estimate rates of change and interpret what they mean in context.     Conceptual Levels of the Derivative  Mathematics solves problems partly with technical tools, but also by translating between different levels of meaning. Many problems begin in a physical or geometric setting. We often translate them into a numerical or algebraic setting where our tools apply, then translate the result back to the original context.  Our key concept so far has been the derivative . For a function , the derivative has several complementary meanings.    Physical:  is the rate of change of with respect to . For a specific input , describes how fast changes near .   Geometric:  is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at .   Numerical: we approximate the derivative using a difference quotient where is small. As , the average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate of change.   Algebraic: we compute derivatives from formulas using derivative rules and known basic derivatives. Occasionally we return to the definition      Functions of Motion  Many applications of derivatives involve motion. In this subsection, all quantities are functions of time .    Position (or displacement) : distance past a reference point (for example, in feet) at time seconds.   Velocity  : the rate of change of position (ft\/sec). Velocity may be negative. Speed is .   Acceleration  : the rate of change of velocity (ft\/sec 2 ). A useful benchmark is one gee , about ft\/sec 2 , the free-fall acceleration near Earth’s surface.   Jerk  : the rate of change of acceleration (ft\/sec 3 ).     Car Stopping  Consider a car whose speedometer data is represented by the velocity graph below. Remember: velocity is the derivative of position, so the level of is the slope of .   Velocity data from a car’s speedometer.    Since , a constant velocity corresponds to a distance graph with constant slope. If the velocity suddenly drops to zero, the distance graph becomes flat.   Distance consistent with the velocity graph.    Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, , so the slope of the velocity graph becomes the level of the acceleration graph. The transition is very steep, so the average acceleration over that short time is large.    Acceleration is near zero except during the sudden stop.     These graphs describe a car going from about 40 mph to 0 in about 0.1 seconds. That is not normal braking. It indicates a crash. The deceleration is roughly gees for a brief moment, which would feel like many times your weight pressing into the seatbelt.     Braking Techniques and Jerk  Now imagine braking steadily at a traffic light, slowing at a constant rate until the car stops. Here the velocity decreases linearly, and the acceleration is roughly constant.    A steady stop: acceleration is roughly constant (left), velocity decreases linearly (middle), and distance levels off smoothly (right).      Even if the deceleration is not large, an abrupt change in acceleration produces a noticeable jolt. That jolt corresponds to a large value of jerk for a brief moment.  To reduce jerk, the acceleration should change gradually: squeeze the brake down and release it smoothly. This makes the acceleration graph rise and fall instead of jumping suddenly.   Smoother braking reduces jerk, but it may require a longer stopping time to keep peak deceleration reasonable.       Smoother changes in acceleration often require a longer stopping distance and time. In driving terms: if you want a gentle stop without a jolt, you usually need to begin braking earlier.     The Ballistic Equation  A basic model for vertical motion under constant gravity is the ballistic equation :   Here is the initial height, is the initial velocity, and is a positive constant representing the strength of gravity. Differentiating reveals the relationships among position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk.     Under standard gravity ft\/sec 2 , suppose a ball is thrown straight up from height ft. How large must be so that the ball hits the ground after seconds? How high does it go?    The model is . Landing at means .   so and therefore ft\/sec.  The velocity is . The ball reaches its highest point when .   The height at that time is ft.  For the velocity is positive (the ball rises). For the velocity is negative (the ball falls).     The graph of is a downward-opening parabola in , representing height over time. It is not the full two-dimensional flight path of the ball, since horizontal motion is ignored in this model.     Practice: Translating Between Levels    A position graph is increasing and concave down on an interval. Describe what this says about the signs of and on that interval.      A velocity graph is above the -axis and decreasing. What can you conclude about the motion of the object? Include a statement about speed and acceleration.      Suppose a car’s acceleration graph has a sharp jump at a moment in time. What does this suggest about the jerk? Give a real-world interpretation.     "

  "body": " Related Rates    Set up a related rates problem by identifying variables, constants, current values, and known rates.  Write a geometric relationship among variables, then differentiate with respect to time using the Chain Rule.  Compute an unknown rate at a specific instant by substituting current values only at the end.  Check answers for sign and real-world plausibility, including unit consistency.     Pulley Example  Consider a weight hanging from a rope that goes up to a pulley 10 ft above the floor and then down to your hand, which is 3 ft above the floor and 15 ft horizontally from the pulley. If you walk away from the pulley at ft\/sec, how fast will the weight rise?  This is a related rates problem: we want an unknown rate of change from a known rate, using a geometric relationship. Start by drawing a picture and labeling constants and variables. Let be the horizontal distance from the weight to your hand, and let be the length of the rope segment from the pulley to your hand. The problem gives the current value and the current rate (ft\/sec). We want .   Pulley setup with variables and .    The vertical distance from your hand up to the pulley is constant: ft. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the geometry implies   One approach is to solve for and then differentiate.   Now substitute the current values:   The weight rises at the same rate that the rope segment increases, so the weight rises at about ft\/sec at that instant.   Plug in the current values only at the last step. If you substitute before differentiating, you turn variables into constants and their derivatives become zero.   We can also do this more directly by implicitly differentiating the relationship .   Since , this gives the same numerical result as above.    A Method for Related Rates Problems   Draw a picture labeled with:  numerical constant values,  letter variables and their current values,  arrows showing known current rates (derivatives),  an arrow for the unknown target rate you want.    Write an equation relating the variables using geometry (or a known formula).  Assume each variable depends on time , then differentiate both sides with respect to . Use the Chain Rule whenever a variable appears inside a power, root, trig function, etc. Solve for the target derivative if needed.  Substitute the current values and current rates to compute the target rate.     Spill Radius Example  A stream of water spreads a circular puddle on the floor. If the puddle is 1 meter across and the stream increases the area at a rate of m 2 \/min, how quickly is the puddle widening at that instant?   A growing circular puddle with radius and area .    Let be the puddle’s radius and its area. A diameter of 1 m means the current radius is . The given rate is m 2 \/min. We want .  The geometric relationship is Differentiate both sides with respect to time:   Solve for the target rate and substitute the current values:    Always check plausibility. A radius increase of about 0.6 m per minute can be reasonable, depending on flow rate and surface.     Searchlight Example  A searchlight shines along a wall 20 meters away. If the light is currently away from pointing directly at the wall and the light is rotating at per second, what is the speed of the bright spot moving along the wall at that instant?   The spotlight position depends on the angle .    Let be the angle and the distance of the spot from the point on the wall closest to the light. The geometry gives so   Differentiate with respect to time:   Trig derivatives require radians. Convert the current angle and angular speed:   Now compute:   Since , we have , so    The problem asks for speed , so report . If the rotation direction were opposite, the derivative would change sign but the speed would be the same.    If you mistakenly use in degrees\/sec inside the derivative formula, the numerical answer will be wrong. Convert to radians\/sec before substituting.     Flashlight Examples  A flashlight shines a cone of light straight toward a wall. The lit region on the wall is a circle. What is the rate of change of the lit circular area if: (a) the flashlight moves toward the wall at 2 m\/sec; (b) the flashlight stays 5 m from the wall, but the focus narrows so the total angle decreases at per second?   Case (a): Moving Toward the Wall   As the flashlight moves, similar triangles relate the radius to the distance .    Let be the distance from the wall, the radius of the lit circle, and its area. We are given , , and . Similar triangles show , so , and therefore .  Differentiate and substitute:   The negative sign matches the situation: as the flashlight moves closer, the circle on the wall shrinks.    Case (b): Narrowing the Beam  Now the distance is constant at 5 m, but the beam angle changes. Let be the total cone angle and let be the radius of the lit circle. The right triangle in the diagram uses the half-angle :   Differentiate using the Chain Rule:   We are given , so . Convert to radians\/sec: .  We are not given , but we are given and distance 5 m, so . Also, using the same right triangle, the adjacent side is 5 and the opposite side is , so the hypotenuse squared is , giving .  Substitute into the derivative formula:   The sign makes sense: the beam narrows, so the lit area decreases.   A quick check: . If the angle is decreasing at about \/sec, the circle can shrink very quickly at that instant, so a relatively large negative area rate is plausible.      Practice Problems    In the pulley example, explain why substituting into before differentiating leads to an incorrect conclusion about .      A circular disk has radius and area . If is constant and positive, describe how the sign and size of change as grows.      In the searchlight example, identify which step requires converting degrees to radians, and explain why that conversion is essential.     "
