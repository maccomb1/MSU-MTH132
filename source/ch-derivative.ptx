  <title>The Derivative</title>

  
  <introduction>
    <p>
Derivatives provide a precise way to measure how one quantity changes with respect to another. They are defined 
using limits and give meaning to concepts such as instantaneous rate of change and the slope of a tangent line. 
Before we apply derivatives to a wide range of real-world problems, it is essential to understand where derivatives 
come from and how they are computed.

    <p>
In this chapter, we focus on developing the derivative itself. We begin with motivation and the limit-based 
definition of the derivative, then build a toolkit of differentiation rules. Along the way, we learn how to 
differentiate trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, apply the Chain Rule, work with implicitly 
defined relationships, and compute derivatives of inverse functions. The emphasis here is on understanding the 
structure of derivatives and gaining fluency with the core techniques.

    <p>
Major applications of derivatives are intentionally postponed until the next chapter. In Chapter 3, we will 
use derivatives to study motion, related rates, linear approximation, optimization, and the overall behavior 
of functions. Mastering the ideas and skills in this chapter provides the foundation needed to apply 
derivatives effectively and confidently in those settings.
