  <title>Limits and Continuity</title>

<introduction>
<p>
How can we describe the speed of a car at the exact moment you glance at the speedometer,
or predict the height of a ball just before it hits the ground?
Questions like these require understanding what happens as one quantity gets closer and closer
to another. This idea is captured precisely by limits.
</p>

<p>
Limits provide a precise way to describe how functions behave near a point,
even when the function may not be defined at that point.
They form the foundation of calculus.
Derivatives rely on limits to describe instantaneous rates of change,
and integrals use limits to measure accumulated change.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we study limits using graphs, tables, and algebraic techniques.
We develop rules for computing limits and explore how concepts such as continuity
and the Intermediate Value Theorem fit into the bigger picture.
Mastering limits is the first major step toward understanding the core ideas and tools of calculus.
