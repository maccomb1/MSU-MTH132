  <title>Limits and Continuity</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    Have you ever wondered how we can describe the speed of a car at the exact instant you look at the speedometer, 
    or how to predict the height of a ball the moment before it hits the ground? Questions like these involve 
    understanding what happens as one quantity gets closer and closer to another â€” and that is exactly what 
    <term>limits</term> are designed to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Limits give us a precise language to talk about the behavior of functions near a point, even when the function 
    itself may not be defined there. They are the foundation of all of calculus: the <term>derivative</term> uses 
    limits to capture instantaneous rates of change, while the <term>integral</term> uses them to measure the total 
    accumulation of change.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this chapter we will explore limits from graphs, tables, and algebra, learn the rules that allow us to compute 
    them, and see how ideas like continuity and the Intermediate Value Theorem connect everything together. 
    Understanding limits is the first big step toward making sense of the powerful tools of calculus.
