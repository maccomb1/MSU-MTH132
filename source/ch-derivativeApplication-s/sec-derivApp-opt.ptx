  <p>
    In many applications, we are not just interested in computing derivatives.
    Instead, we use derivatives as a tool to make the best possible choice:
    the largest area, the smallest cost, the least time, or the greatest profit.
    These sorts of real-world problems are called <term>optimization problems</term>.

    <example xml:id="ex-opt-rectangle">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we have <m>40</m> meters of fencing to enclose a rectangular area.
           What dimensions maximize the area?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The constraint comes from the perimeter:
        </p>
        <me>
          2\ell+2w=40.
        </me>

        <p>
          Solve for one variable in terms of the other. For example,
        </p>
        <me>
          w=20-\ell.
        </me>

        <p>
          The area is the target quantity:
        </p>
        <me>
          A=\ell w=\ell(20-\ell)=20\ell-\ell^2.
        </me>

        <p>
          The physical domain requires <m>\ell\ge 0</m> and <m>w\ge 0</m>, so
          <m>\ell\in[0,20]</m>.
          Now we find the absolute maximum of <m>A(\ell)</m> on <m>[0,20]</m>.
        </p>

        <me>
          A'(\ell)=20-2\ell.
        </me>

        <p>
          The critical point satisfies <m>A'(\ell)=0</m>, so <m>\ell=10</m>.
          Evaluate the candidates:
        </p>

        <me>
          A(0)=0,\qquad A(10)=100,\qquad A(20)=0.
        </me>

        <p>
          The largest value occurs at <m>\ell=10</m>.
          Therefore <m>w=20-\ell=10</m>.
          The rectangle of greatest area is a square.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    
 <p>Since we will be looking for absolute extrema, it is great that we have a technique already for when the domain is a closed interval (like in our last example).
      But what if the domain is open or unbounded? For such cases, it is useful to have the following two results.

            </li> 
          </ul> 
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    
    <p>Now let's summarize the overall technique for solving optimization problems.</p>



    <algorithm xml:id="strat-optimization-method">
      <title>Technique for Optimization</title>
      <p>
        Most optimization problems follow the same workflow:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Draw a labeled picture (if appropriate). Identify the controlling variable(s),
          the constraint(s), and the target quantity you want to maximize or minimize.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write equations that relate the variables using geometry, formulas, or context.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose one controlling variable as the independent variable and rewrite the target quantity
          as a single-variable function <m>T(x)</m> (in our previous example our target quantity was area). Determine the domain of <m>x</m>.
        </li>
        <li> <p> 
          Find the desired absolute extrema of <m>T(x)</m> on its domain by one of 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <xref ref="strat-extrema">Closed Interval Method</xref> if the domain is a closed interval.  
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <xref ref="thm-abs-ext-first-deriv-test">First Derivative Test for Absolute Extrema</xref> 
                if the domain is open or unbounded and the critical point is the only candidate.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The <xref ref="thm-abs-ext-second-deriv-test">Second Derivative Test for Absolute Extrema</xref> 
                if the domain is open or unbounded and the critical point is the only candidate (and it is difficult to analyze the sign of the first derivative).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
        </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          Interpret your answer in context and check that it makes sense.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </algorithm>

      
<p>And with that we are ready to solve optimization problems! Similar to related rates problems, 
  the key is to practice the technique on a variety of examples so that you can recognize the pattern and apply it efficiently.

  <subsection xml:id="ssec-opt-examples">
    <title>More Examples</title>

    <example xml:id="ex-opt-bucket">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A 10-quart bucket has cylindrical sides and a circular bottom (no top).
          What radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> minimize the surface area of the sides and bottom?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The target quantity is the surface area
        </p>

        <me>
          S=\pi r^2+2\pi rh.
        </me>

        <p>
          The constraint is the volume. Converting 10 quarts to cubic inches gives
          <m>V=577.5</m> in<superscript>3</superscript>, so
        </p>

        <me>
          V=\pi r^2h=577.5.
        </me>

        <p>
          Use the constraint to write <m>h</m> in terms of <m>r</m>:
        </p>

        <me>
          h=\frac{577.5}{\pi r^2}.
        </me>

        <p>
          Substitute into <m>S</m> to obtain a single-variable function:
        </p>

        <me>
          S(r)=\pi r^2+2\pi r\left(\frac{577.5}{\pi r^2}\right)
          =\pi r^2+\frac{1155}{r}.
        </me>

        <p>
          The domain is <m>r&gt;0</m>. Differentiate:
        </p>

        <me>
          S'(r)=2\pi r-\frac{1155}{r^2}.
        </me>

        <p>
          Set <m>S'(r)=0</m>:
        </p>

        <me>
          2\pi r=\frac{1155}{r^2}
          \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
          r^3=\frac{1155}{2\pi}
          \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
          r=\sqrt[3]{\frac{1155}{2\pi}}.
        </me>

        <p>
          This is the only critical point. To confirm it is an absolute minimum,
          note that
        </p>

        <me>
          \displaystyle\lim_{r\to 0^+} S(r)=\infty,
          \qquad
          \displaystyle\lim_{r\to\infty} S(r)=\infty.
        </me>

        <p>
          Since the surface area grows without bound at both ends, the single critical point must give
          the absolute minimum.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now compute the corresponding height:
        </p>

        <me>
          h=\frac{577.5}{\pi r^2}
          =\frac{577.5}{\pi\left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{1155}{2\pi}}\right)^2}.
        </me>

        <p>
          In fact, simplifying shows <m>h=r</m>, so the optimal bucket is as tall as its radius.
          This yields a bucket that is twice as wide as it is tall.
        </p>

        <remark>
          <p>
            Real buckets are often designed with other priorities besides minimizing material,
            such as stability, ease of carrying, stackability, and manufacturing constraints.
            Optimization models are most useful when we clearly state what is being optimized
            and what is being ignored.
          </p>
        </remark>
      </solution>
    </example>


    <example xml:id="ex-opt-ants">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A line of ants travels from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner
          of a <m>10</m> cm by <m>10</m> cm square of carpet.
          They may travel along the left or bottom edge at speed <m>1</m> cm/sec,
          and then cut across the carpet at speed <m>\tfrac12</m> cm/sec.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>e</m> be the distance traveled along an edge before entering the carpet.
          Find the value of <m>e</m> that minimizes:
          (a) the total distance traveled, and
          (b) the total travel time.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The diagonal segment across the carpet has length <m>c</m>.
          From the right triangle,
        </p>

        <me>
          c^2=10^2+(10-e)^2.
        </me>

        <p>
          Therefore
        </p>

        <me>
          c=\sqrt{200-20e+e^2}.
        </me>

        <p>
          The domain is <m>e\in[0,10]</m>.
          The total distance is

        <me>
          L(e)=e+c=e+\sqrt{200-20e+e^2}.
        </me>

        <p>
          The total time is distance divided by speed.
          Along the edge the speed is <m>1</m>, so time is <m>e</m>.
          Across the carpet the speed is <m>\tfrac12</m>, so time is <m>\frac{c}{1/2}=2c</m>.
          Thus

        <me>
          T(e)=e+2\sqrt{200-20e+e^2}.

          =1-\frac{10-e}{\sqrt{200-20e+e^2}}.
        </me>

        <p>
          Solving <m>L'(e)=0</m> would require
          <m>\sqrt{200-20e+e^2}=10-e</m>. Squaring both sides gives
          <m>200-20e+e^2=(10-e)^2=100-20e+e^2</m>, which reduces to <m>200=100</m>,
          an impossibility. Therefore there are no critical points in <m>(0,10)</m>,
          so the minimum occurs at an endpoint.
        </p>

        <me>
          L(0)=10\sqrt{2},\qquad L(10)=20.
        </me>

        <p>
          Since <m>10\sqrt2&lt;20</m>, the minimum distance occurs at <m>e=0</m>.
          In other words, the straight diagonal is the shortest path.
        </p>

        <p>
          <alert>(b) Minimize time.</alert>
          Differentiate:

          T'(e)=1+(2)\cdot\frac{1}{2}(200-20e+e^2)^{-1/2}(2e-20)

        <me>
          \sqrt{200-20e+e^2}=20-2e.
        </me>

        <p>
          Square both sides and simplify:
        </p>

        <me>
          200-20e+e^2=(20-2e)^2
          \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
          3e^2-60e+200=0.
        </me>

        <p>
          Apply the quadratic formula:

        <me>
          e=\frac{60\pm\sqrt{60^2-4(3)(200)}}{2(3)}

        </me>

        <p>
          Only <m>e=10-\frac{10}{3}\sqrt{3}</m> lies in <m>[0,10]</m>, so it is our only critical point.
          Compare to the endpoints:
        </p>

        <me>
          T(0)=20\sqrt2,\qquad T(10)=30,\qquad
          T\!\left(10-\frac{10}{3}\sqrt3\right)=10+10\sqrt3.
        </me>

        <p>
          Since <m>10+10\sqrt3</m> is the smallest of these values, the minimum time occurs at
          <m>\displaystyle e=10-\frac{10}{3}\sqrt3\approx 4.2</m>.
        </p>

        <remark>
          <p>
            Minimizing distance and minimizing time are different problems because the speed changes.
            The ants save time by traveling partway along the faster edge and then cutting across the slower carpet.

        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>T'(c)=0</m>, then <m>x=c</m> must give an absolute maximum or minimum of <m>T</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <emph>False.</emph> A critical point is only a candidate. The absolute extremum could occur at an endpoint,
            and some critical points are neither maxima nor minima.

      <exercise xml:id="tf-opt-02">
        <statement>
          <p>
            In an optimization problem on a closed interval, it is always necessary to check endpoints.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <emph>True.</emph> Absolute maxima and minima can occur at endpoints, so they must be included as candidates.
          </p>
        </solution>

      <exercise xml:id="tf-opt-03">
        <statement>
          <p>
            If the domain is <m>(0,\infty)</m>, then an absolute minimum cannot exist.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <emph>False.</emph> An absolute minimum may exist on an open or unbounded domain,
            but we must justify it by analyzing critical points and limits at the boundaries.

        <statement>
          <p>
            You have 48 meters of fencing to enclose a rectangle.
            What dimensions maximize area, and what is the maximum area?

            A person walks along a sidewalk at <m>4</m> m/s and then crosses a field at <m>2</m> m/s.
            Sketch a diagram and set up a time function similar to the ants problem.
            Explain what your independent variable is and what domain it must satisfy.
