    <title>Introduction to Related Rates</title>

    <p>
      Many real-world situations involve quantities that change over time. In some cases, the rates of change of certain
      quantities are known, and we want to find the rates of change of other related quantities. These problems are called
      <term>related rates</term> problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key steps in solving related rates problems are:

      Related rates problems often involve geometric relationships, such as those found in triangles, circles, or other shapes. Some students find 
      that every problem feels a bit different, but the overall method remains consistent across various scenarios. </p> 
      <p> 
      Remember that our <xref ref="formula-sheet">formula sheet, included in Appendix </xref> includes many geometric formulas that can be useful in setting up these problems and that many of the 
      quantities involved may depend on time, even if not explicitly stated (so the chain rule will often be needed).

<p>Now that we have the technique outlined, let's explore some examples to see how these steps are applied in practice.</p>

    <statement>
    <p>
      A stream of water spreads a circular puddle on the floor. If the puddle is 1 meter across and the stream increases the area at a rate of
      <m>2</m> m<m>^2</m>/min, how quickly is the puddle's radius widening at that instant?
    </p>

      <image source="images/RelatedRates1.gif" width="80%">
    <shortdescription>
      An animation on a coordinate grid showing a circle centered at the origin expanding outward over time, modeling a circular puddle that is widening.
      The circle represents the puddle’s boundary and grows smoothly, indicating increasing radius and diameter.
      The situation corresponds to the instant when the puddle’s diameter is 1 meter and the area is increasing at 2 square meters per minute, and the goal is to determine how fast the radius is increasing at that instant.
    </shortdescription>
    </image>
    </figure>


    </statement>
    <solution>
    <p> We can see in this problem that they give us the rate of change of the area of the puddle, 
      and we are asked to find the rate of change of the radius, these are the two rates we are try to relate together in this problem. </p>
      <p>So for this problem, since the puddle is circular, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is <m>A=\pi r^2</m>, where <m>r</m> 
        is the radius of the circle. </p>
      <p>Since both the area and the radius are changing over time, we can express them as functions of time: <m>A(t)</m> and <m>r(t)</m>.</p>
      <p>We are given that the area is increasing at a rate of <m>2</m> m<m>^2</m>/min, which means <m>A'(t)=2</m> m<m>^2</m>/min. 
        We are asked to find how quickly the radius is widening, which means we need to find <m>r'(t)</m>.</p>
      <p>To find <m>r'(t)</m>, we can differentiate the area formula with respect to time using the Chain Rule:</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle A(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \pi r(t)^2,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle A'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \pi \cdot 2r(t) \cdot r'(t)
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 2\pi r(t) r'(t).
\end{array}
      </me>
      <p>Now we can solve for <m>r'(t)</m>:</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{A'(t)}{2\pi r(t)}.
\end{array}
      </me>
      <p>Now we will take the <m>t=0</m> to be the time where the puddle is 1 meter across (so <m>r(0)=\frac12</m>). Recall also we know that <m>A'(0)=2</m>. So therefore:</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r'(0)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{A'(0)}{2\pi r(0)}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{2}{2\pi(\frac12)}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{2}{\pi}
\end{array}
      </me> 
      <p> So the radius is widening at a rate of <m>\frac{2}{\pi}</m> m/min when the puddle is 1 meter across. </p>
      </solution>

  <title>Pulley Example</title>
    <statement>
     <p>
      Consider a weight hanging from a rope that goes up to a pulley 10 ft above the floor and then down to your hand,
      which is 3 ft above the floor and 15 ft horizontally from the pulley. If you walk away from the pulley at
      <m>2</m> ft/sec, how fast will the weight rise?
    </p>


    <figure xml:id="fig-pulley">

    A pulley system with a hanging weight and a rope held by a person walking away from the pulley.

      <image source="images/RelatedRates2.gif" width="100%">
    <shortdescription>
      An animated diagram on a grid showing a pulley mounted above the floor with a rope passing over it.
      On the left, a weight hangs vertically from the pulley down to the floor.
      On the right, a person holds the other end of the rope at a point 3 feet above the floor and moves horizontally to the right.
      An arrow indicates the person walking away from the pulley at a constant speed of 2 feet per second.
      As the person moves farther away, the rope segment from the pulley to the person lengthens and the vertical rope segment shortens,
      illustrating that the hanging weight is rising.
    </shortdescription>
    </image>
    </figure>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          First let's define our variables. Let <m>x(t)</m> be the horizontal distance from the pulley to your hand,
          let <m>r(t)</m> be the length of the rope segment from the pulley to your hand, and finally let <m>h(t)</m> be the height (vertical distance) from your hand to the pulley. 
        </p> 
        <p> Since your hand is 3 ft above the floor and the pulley is 10 ft above the floor, the height <m>h(t)</m> between the two will be a constant can be expressed as:</p>
        <me>
\displaystyle h(t)
= \displaystyle 10-3
= \displaystyle 7
        </me>
        <p>So no matter the time, <m>h(t)=7</m> is constant. Also notice that because the rope is connected to the weight, as the rope length 
          <m>r(t)</m> increases, the height of the weight will decrease at the same rate. So if we can find <m>r'(t)</m>, we will also have found the rate 
          at which the weight is rising. </p>
          <p> 
          Finally, notice that these three variables (<m>r(t)</m>, <m>h(t)</m>, and <m>x(t)</m>) form a right triangle 
          with the hypotenuse being the rope segment from the pulley to your hand. So we can use the Pythagorean theorem to get: </p>
        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle h(t)^2 + x(t)^2,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 7^2 + x(t)^2,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 49 + x(t)^2.
\end{array}
        </me>
        <p>Now we can differentiate both sides with respect to time <m>t</m> using the Chain Rule:</p>
        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle \left(r(t)^2\right)'
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \left(49 + x(t)^2\right)',
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle 2r(t) r'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 2x(t) x'(t).
\end{array}
        </me>
        <p>Now we can solve for <m>r'(t)</m>:</p>
        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{x(t) x'(t)}{r(t)}.
\end{array}
        </me>
        <p>Next we can let <m>t=0</m> be the time of interest (when we are 15 ft from the pulley), so <m>x(0)=15</m> and <m>x'(0)=2</m>.</p>
        <p>Also, at time <m>t=0</m>, we can compute <m>r(0)</m> using the Pythagorean theorem:</p>
        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r(0)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 49 + x(0)^2
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r(0)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 49 + 15^2
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r(0)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 49 + 225
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r(0)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 274
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r(0)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \sqrt{274}.
\end{array}
        </me>
        <p>Substituting into our expression for <m>r'(t)</m>:</p>
        <me>
          \begin{array}{rcl}
            \displaystyle r'(0)
            \amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{x(0) x'(0)}{r(0)}
            \\[1.5em]
            \amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{15 \cdot 2}{\sqrt{274}}
            \\[1.5em]
            \amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{30}{\sqrt{274}}.
          \end{array}
        </me>
        <p>So the rope length is increasing at a rate of <m>\frac{30}{\sqrt{274}}</m> ft/sec when 
          you are 15 ft from the pulley which means that the box is rising at the same rate of <m>\frac{30}{\sqrt{274}}</m> ft/sec.</p>
      </solution>

    <p>
      A searchlight shines along a wall 20 meters away. If the light is currently <m>30^\circ</m> away from pointing directly at the wall
      and the light is rotating at <m>5^\circ</m> per second, what is the speed of the bright spot moving along the wall at that instant?
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>We are intentionally not providing a figure for this example (until you look at the solution). Try drawing your own diagram to help visualize the situation.

      </p>
    </remark>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Here is a sketch of the situation:
      </p>
          <figure xml:id="fig-searchlight">
  <caption>
    This diagram models the related-rates problem stated above asking how fast the illuminated spot on the wall is moving upward at that instant.
  </caption>
      <image source="images/RelatedRates3.PNG" width="100%">
    <shortdescription>
      A diagram on a grid showing a vertical wall on the left and a searchlight on the ground to the right.
      A straight beam of light extends from the searchlight to a point on the wall.
      At the searchlight, the beam makes a 30 degree angle with the horizontal ground.
      A curved arrow at the searchlight indicates that the beam is rotating upward at a rate of 5 degrees per second.
      The illuminated point on the wall is above the ground and moves vertically as the beam rotates,
      illustrating the changing height of the light spot on the wall.
    </shortdescription>
    </image>
    </figure>

      <p>
        Let <m>\theta(t)</m> be the angle of the light beam from the horizontal and <m>s(t)</m> be the distance of the spot from the point on the wall closest to the light.
        We are given that at some time of interest (which we will call <m>t=0</m>) that <m>\theta(0)=30^\circ</m> and <m>\theta'(0)=5^\circ/\text{sec}</m>, and we want to find <m>s'(0)</m>.
      </p>

      <p> Since the situation is about a right triangle formed by the light beam, the wall, and the ground, 
        we have several options to consider (like sine, cosine, or tangent or the pythagorean theorem). However, to relate the 
        angle and the distance along the wall we should use the tangent function. This gives:</p>
      <me>
        \tan(\theta(t)) = \frac{s(t)}{20}
      </me>
      <p> Differentiating both sides with respect to time:</p>
      <me>
        \sec^2(\theta(t)) \cdot \theta'(t) = \frac{s'(t)}{20}
      </me>
      <p> Solving for <m>s'(t)</m>:</p>
      <me>
        s'(t) = 20 \cdot \sec^2(\theta(t)) \cdot \theta'(t)
      </me>
      <p> Now we can substitute in our known values at <m>t=0</m>:</p>
      <me>
        s'(0) = 20 \cdot \sec^2(30^\circ) \cdot 5^\circ/\text{sec}
      </me>
      <p> However, because the trig differentiation formulas are only valid for radian measure (See <xref ref="rem-radians-warning"/>), we need to convert 
        he angle and angular speed to radians before substituting:</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle 30^\circ
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 30\left(\frac{2\pi}{360}\right)
\ =\ \frac{\pi}{6}\ \text{rad},
\\[1.0em]
\displaystyle 5^\circ/\text{sec}
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 5\left(\frac{2\pi}{360}\right)
\ =\ \frac{\pi}{36}\ \text{rad/sec}.
\end{array}
      </me>
      <p> Now substituting in:</p> 
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle s'(0)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 20 \cdot \sec^2\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) \cdot \frac{\pi}{36}
\end{array}
      </me>
      <p> Since <m>\cos(\pi/6)=\sqrt{3}/2</m>, we have <m>\sec^2(\pi/6)=\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2=\frac{4}{3}</m>, so</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle s'(0)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 20 \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{\pi}{36}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{20\pi}{27}

\end{array}
      </me>
      <p> So the speed of the bright spot moving along the wall at that instant is <m>\frac{20}{27}\pi</m> m/sec. </p>

    <remark xml:id="rem-sign-speed">
      <p>
        The problem asks for <emph>speed</emph>, so report <m>|s'(0)|</m>. If the rotation direction were opposite,
        the derivative would change sign but the speed would be the same.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark xml:id="rem-radians-required">
      <p>
        If you mistakenly use <m>\theta'(0)=5</m> in degrees/sec inside the derivative formula, the numerical answer will be wrong.

    <statement>

        In any related rates problem, all quantities that change must be written as functions of time,
        even if time is not mentioned explicitly in the problem.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True</em>. In related rates problems, all variables must be expressed as functions of time to properly apply the chain rule. 
        It is possible that some quantities do not change (and thus are constants), but any quantity that does change must be treated as a function of time.

      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True</em>. Speed is defined as the magnitude of velocity, which is always nonnegative. 
        Therefore, when a related rates problem asks for speed, the final answer should be reported as a nonnegative value, regardless of the sign of the derivative.

        <em>False</em>. While the Pythagorean Theorem is often useful in related rates problems involving right triangles, it is not always necessary.

  <statement>
    <p>
      A ladder 10 ft long is leaning against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at 1 ft/sec,
      then the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at 1 ft/sec when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      <em>False</em>. Let <m>x(t)</m> be the distance from the wall to the bottom of the ladder and <m>y(t)</m> be the height of the top of the ladder on the wall. 
      The relationship between <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
    </p>
    <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle x(t)^2 + y(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 10^2,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle x(t)^2 + y(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 100.
\end{array}
    </me>
    <p>Differentiating both sides with respect to time:</p>
    <me>
\displaystyle 2x(t)x'(t) + 2y(t)y'(t)
= \displaystyle 0.
    </me>
    <p>Solving for <m>y'(t)</m>:</p>
    <me>
\displaystyle y'(t)
= \displaystyle -\frac{x(t)x'(t)}{y(t)}.
    </me>
    <p>At the instant when <m>x(t) = 6</m> ft and <m>x'(t) = 1</m> ft/sec, we can find <m>y(t)</m> using the Pythagorean theorem:</p>
    <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle 6^2 + y(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 100,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle 36 + y(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 100,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle y(t)^2
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 64,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle y(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 8 \text{ ft}.
\end{array}
    </me>
    <p>Substituting these values into the equation for <m>y'(t)</m>:</p>
    <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle y'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle -\frac{6 \cdot 1}{8}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle -\frac{3}{4} \text{ ft/sec}.
\end{array}
    </me>
    <p>This shows that the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall at a rate of <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> ft/sec, not 1 ft/sec as stated.</p>

  <exercise xml:id="rr-tf-03">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If the radius of a sphere is increasing at a constant rate, then the volume of the sphere is also
        increasing at a constant rate.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula <m>V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3</m>. 
        If the radius <m>r</m> is increasing at a constant rate, the volume <m>V</m> will not increase at a constant rate because the relationship between volume and radius is cubic. 
        As the radius increases, the rate of change of the volume will also increase.
      </p>
      <p>A simple example would be if <m>r(t) = t</m> (which has a constant rate of change of <m>r'(t) = 1</m>), then <m>V(t) = \frac{4}{3}\pi t^3</m>, and the derivative <m>V'(t) = 4\pi t^2</m> is not constant.</p>
    </solution>
