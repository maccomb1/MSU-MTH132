    <title>Introduction to Related Rates</title>

    <p>
      Many real-world situations involve quantities that change over time. In some cases, the rates of change of certain
      quantities are known, and we want to find the rates of change of other related quantities. These problems are called
      <term>related rates</term> problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key steps in solving related rates problems are:

<remark xml:id="rem-related-rates-overview">
    <p>
      Related rates problems often involve geometric relationships, such as those found in triangles, circles, or other shapes. Some students find 
      that every problem feels a bit different, but the overall method remains consistent across various scenarios. </p> 
      <p> 
      Remember that our <xref ref="formula-sheet">formula sheet, included in Appendix </xref> includes many geometric formulas that can be useful in setting up these problems and that many of the 
      quantities involved may depend on time, even if not explicitly stated (so the chain rule will often be needed).

<p>Now that we have the technique outlined, let's explore some examples to see how these steps are applied in practice.</p>

    <title>Spill Example</title>
    <statement>
    <p>
      A stream of water spreads a circular puddle on the floor. If the puddle is 1 meter across and the stream increases the area at a rate of
      <m>2</m> m<m>^2</m>/min, how quickly is the puddle's radius widening at that instant?
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-puddle">

    A circular puddle grows as water spreads outward.

      <image source="images/RelatedRates1.gif" width="80%">
    <shortdescription>
      An animation on a coordinate grid showing a circle centered at the origin expanding outward over time, modeling a circular puddle that is widening.
      The circle represents the puddle’s boundary and grows smoothly, indicating increasing radius and diameter.
      The situation corresponds to the instant when the puddle’s diameter is 1 meter and the area is increasing at 2 square meters per minute, and the goal is to determine how fast the radius is increasing at that instant.
    </shortdescription>
    </image>
    </figure>


    </statement>
    <solution>
    <p> We can see in this problem that they give us the rate of change of the area of the puddle, 
      and we are asked to find the rate of change of the radius, these are the two rates we are try to relate together in this problem. </p>
      <p>So for this problem, since the puddle is circular, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is <m>A=\pi r^2</m>, where <m>r</m> 
        is the radius of the circle. </p>
      <p>Since both the area and the radius are changing over time, we can express them as functions of time: <m>A(t)</m> and <m>r(t)</m>.</p>
      <p>We are given that the area is increasing at a rate of <m>2</m> m<m>^2</m>/min, which means <m>A'(t)=2</m> m<m>^2</m>/min. 
        We are asked to find how quickly the radius is widening, which means we need to find <m>r'(t)</m>.</p>
      <p>To find <m>r'(t)</m>, we can differentiate the area formula with respect to time using the Chain Rule:</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle A(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \pi r(t)^2,
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle A'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \pi \cdot 2r(t) \cdot r'(t)
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 2\pi r(t) r'(t).
\end{array}
      </me>
      <p>Now we can solve for <m>r'(t)</m>:</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{A'(t)}{2\pi r(t)}.
\end{array}
      </me>
      <p>Now we will take the <m>t=0</m> to be the time where the puddle is 1 meter across (so <m>r(0)=\frac12</m>). Recall also we know that <m>A'(0)=2</m>. So therefore:</p>
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r'(0)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{A'(0)}{2\pi r(0)}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{2}{2\pi(\frac12)}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{2}{\pi}
\end{array}
      </me> 
      <p> So the radius is widening at a rate of <m>\frac{2}{\pi}</m> m/min when the puddle is 1 meter across. </p>
      </solution>

 <example
  xml:id="example-pulley">
  <title>Pulley Example</title>
    <statement>
     <p>
      Consider a weight hanging from a rope that goes up to a pulley 10 ft above the floor and then down to your hand,
      which is 3 ft above the floor and 15 ft horizontally from the pulley. If you walk away from the pulley at
      <m>2</m> ft/sec, how fast will the weight rise?
    </p>


    <figure xml:id="fig-pulley">
  <caption>
    A pulley system with a hanging weight and a rope held by a person walking away from the pulley.
  </caption>
      <image source="images/RelatedRates2.gif" width="80%">
    <shortdescription>
      An animated diagram on a grid showing a pulley mounted above the floor with a rope passing over it.
      On the left, a weight hangs vertically from the pulley down to the floor.
      On the right, a person holds the other end of the rope at a point 3 feet above the floor and moves horizontally to the right.
      An arrow indicates the person walking away from the pulley at a constant speed of 2 feet per second.
      As the person moves farther away, the rope segment from the pulley to the person lengthens and the vertical rope segment shortens,
      illustrating that the hanging weight is rising.
    </shortdescription>
    </image>
    </figure>

      </statement>
      
      
 </example>

 


    <p>
      The vertical distance from your hand up to the pulley is constant: <m>10-3=7</m> ft. By the Pythagorean Theorem,
      the geometry implies
      <me>
        r(t)^2=h(t)^2+7^2=h(t)^2+49.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      One approach is to solve for <m>r(t)</m> and then differentiate.
    </p>

    <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r(t) 
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \sqrt{h(t)^2+49}
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{1}{2}(h(t)^2+49)^{-1/2}\cdot \left(h(t)^2+49\right)'
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{1}{2}(h(t)^2+49)^{-1/2}\cdot 2h(t)h'(t)
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{h(t)h'(t)}{\sqrt{h(t)^2+49}}.
\end{array}
    </me>

    <p>
      Now substitute the current values:
    </p>

    <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle r'(0)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{h(0)\,h'(0)}{\sqrt{h(0)^2+49}}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{(15)(2)}{\sqrt{15^2+49}}
\\[0.9em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{30}{\sqrt{274}}
\approx 1.8\ \text{ft/sec}.
\end{array}
    </me>

    <p>
      The weight rises at the same rate that the rope segment <m>r(t)</m> increases, so the weight rises at about
      <m>1.8</m> ft/sec at that instant.
    </p>

    <remark xml:id="rem-plug-in-last">
      <p>
        Plug in the current values only at the <emph>last</emph> step. If you substitute before differentiating,
        you turn variables into constants and their derivatives become zero.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p>
      We can also do this more directly by implicitly differentiating the relationship <m>r(t)^2=h(t)^2+49</m>.
    </p>

    <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle \left(r(t)^2\right)'
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \left(h(t)^2+49\right)'
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle 2r(t)r'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 2h(t)h'(t)
\\[0.9em]
\displaystyle r'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle \frac{h(t)h'(t)}{r(t)}.
\end{array}
    </me>

    <p>
      Since <m>r(0)=\sqrt{h(0)^2+49}=\sqrt{274}</m>, this gives the same numerical result as above.

      Let <m>\theta(t)</m> be the angle and <m>s(t)</m> the distance of the spot from the point on the wall closest to the light.
      The geometry gives

      A flashlight shines a cone of light straight toward a wall. The lit region on the wall is a circle.
