    <title>Prerequisite Review</title>
    <p>
      In this section there are several types of problems that require us to be able to solve inequalities. Problems such as
      determining when an object is moving in the positive direction, or speeding up, or when it has a negative acceleration. 
    </p>
    <p>
  If you feel a bit out of practice with inequalities, it may be helpful
  to revisit those ideas via the <xref ref="sec-precalc-ineq">Precalculus Review: Inequalities</xref> section before proceeding.
</p>
</warning>

    <p>
      Mathematics solves problems partly with technical tools, but also by translating between different levels of meaning.
      Many problems begin in a physical or geometric setting. We often translate them into a numerical or algebraic setting
      where our tools apply, then translate the result back to the original context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our key concept so far has been the <term>derivative</term>. For a function <m>y=f(x)</m>, the derivative has several
      complementary meanings.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Physical:</em> <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)</m> is the rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
        For a specific input <m>a</m>, <m>f'(a)</m> describes how fast <m>f(x)</m> changes near <m>x=a</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Geometric:</em> <m>f'(a)</m> is the slope of the tangent line to the graph <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Numerical:</em> we approximate the derivative using a difference quotient
        <me>
          f'(a)\cong \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h},
        </me>
        where <m>h</m> is small. As <m>\Delta x=h\to 0</m>, the average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate of change.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Algebraic:</em> we compute derivatives from formulas using derivative rules and known basic derivatives.
        Occasionally we return to the definition
        <me>
          f'(a)=\displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.
        </me>

    <title>The Basics of Motion</title>

    <p>
      Many applications of derivatives involve motion. In this section, all quantities are functions of time <m>t</m>. Here is a basic set of definitions:
    </p>

<definition xml:id="def-motion-quantities">
  <title>Position, Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>s(t)</m> denote the position of an object at time <m>t</m>, measured relative to a fixed reference point.
      The following quantities describe different aspects of the object’s motion:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <term>Position</term> <m>s(t)</m>:
        the distance past a reference point (for example, in feet) at time <m>t</m> seconds.
      </li>

      <li>
        <term>Velocity</term>
        <m>v(t)=\displaystyle \frac{ds}{dt}=s'(t)</m>:
        the rate of change of position, measured in feet per second.
        Velocity may be negative if the object is moving in the negative direction.
        The <term>speed</term> of the object is the absolute value of velocity,
        <m>|v(t)|</m>.
      </li>

      <li>
        <term>Acceleration</term>
        <m>a(t)=\displaystyle \frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{d^2 s}{dt^2}=s''(t)</m>:
        the rate of change of velocity, measured in feet per second squared.
        A useful benchmark is <term>one gee</term>, approximately
        <m>32</m> ft/sec<m>^2</m>, which is the acceleration due to gravity near Earth’s surface.
      </li>

      <li>
        <term>Jerk</term>
        <m>j(t)=\displaystyle \frac{da}{dt}=\frac{d^3 s}{dt^3}=s'''(t)</m>:
        the rate of change of acceleration, measured in feet per second cubed.

<example xml:id="ex-ball-motion-derivatives">
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A ball is thrown straight up from a height of 6 feet with an initial velocity of 64 ft/sec.
      Its vertical position (height) at time <m>t</m> seconds is modeled by

        <solution>
          <p>
            The ball hits the ground when <m>s(t)=0</m>:

\displaystyle 8t^2 - 32t - 3 = 0.

    Use this to answer the following questions:

  </introduction>

  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        When is the particle moving at a constant speed? Explain how you know.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The particle is moving at a constant speed from time <m>t=2</m> to <m>t=4</m>.
        In interval notation this is <m>[2,4]</m>.
        This is because the velocity graph is flat (horizontal) during this interval,
        indicating that the velocity is not changing.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        When is the particle changing direction? Explain how you know.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The particle is changing direction at time <m>t=5</m>.
        This is because the velocity graph crosses the <m>t</m>-axis at this time,
        indicating that the velocity changes from positive to negative.
        A change in the sign of velocity indicates a change in direction of motion.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </task>
  <task>
    <statement>
      <p>
        What is the acceleration of the particle at time <m>t=1</m>? 
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The acceleration at time <m>t=1</m> is the slope of the velocity graph at that time.
        From the graph, we see that from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=2</m>, the velocity decreases linearly from 4 to 1.
        The slope of this line segment is
        <me>
\displaystyle \frac{1-4}{2-0} = \frac{-3}{2} = -1.5.
        </me> 
        Therefore, the acceleration at time <m>t=1</m> is <m>-1.5</m> units per second squared.

<p>Now that we have reviewed some of the basic concepts of motion, let's move on to some more advanced topics.</p>

 <subsection xml:id="subsec-SpeedingUp-SlowingDown">
    <title>Speeding Up and Slowing Down</title>
  <p>
    Before we proceed, it is important to emphasize the difference between velocity and speed. 
    An object is said to be <em>speeding up</em> when its speed is increasing, and <em>slowing down</em> when its speed is decreasing.
    Let's consider the following example to illustrate this concept before we get our main rule for this section.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex-speeding-up-slowing-down-01">
    <introduction>

          Since speed is the absolute value of velocity, the speed changes from <m>|5|=5</m> m/sec to <m>|9|=9</m> m/sec.
          Because the speed is increasing, the particle is speeding up.

<remark xml:id="rem-speeding-up-slowing-down">
  <p> 
 In summary it is not enough to know whether the velocity is increasing or decreasing to determine if the object is speeding up or slowing down.
 One must also consider the sign of the velocity.
  </p>
  </remark>

<p> Now let's summarize this information as a theorem:</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-speeding-up-slowing-down">
  <title>Speeding Up and Slowing Down</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      <ul> 
      <li> An object is <term>speeding up</term> when its velocity and acceleration have the same sign (either both positive or both negative). </li>
      <li>
      An object is <term>slowing down</term> when its velocity and acceleration have opposite signs (one is positive and the other is negative). </li>
      </ul>
    </p>  
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <title>Justification</title>
    <p>
      If the velocity is positive then it is the same as speed.
      Thus if the acceleration is also positive then the velocity is increasing which means the speed is increasing. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      If the velocity is negative then the speed is the opposite of velocity.
      Thus if the acceleration is also negative then the velocity is decreasing which means the speed is increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two cases are similar.

      Therefore, the object is speeding up on <m>(0,2)\cup(4,\infty)</m> and slowing down on <m>(-\infty,0)\cup(2,4)</m>.
    </p>
  </solution> 
</example>


<p>This completes our discussion of speeding up and slowing down.
We will now move on to discuss total distance traveled and how it differs from displacement, the final new concept in this section. </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-TDT">
    <title>Displacement vs Distance Traveled</title>
<p>
  Many students are probably already familiar with the concept of displacement from your favorite physics class:
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-displacement">
  <title>Displacement</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      The <term>displacement</term> of an object over the time interval <m>[a,b]</m> is how much the object's position changes during that time.
    </p> 
      <p> 
      Displacement is given by
      <me>
        \text{Displacement} = s(b) - s(a),
      </me>
      where <m>s(t)</m> is the position function of the object.
      </p>
    </statement>
</definition> 


<example xml:id="ex-displacement-vs-distance-01">
  <statement>
    <p> 
      Building off of <xref ref="ex-ball-motion-derivatives"/>: Recall the vertical position of the ball is given by
      <me>s(t)=-16t^2+64t+6</me>.
      Find the displacement of the ball from <m>t=1</m> seconds to <m>t=3</m> seconds.
    </p>
  </statement> 
  <solution>
    <p>
      To find the displacement, we evaluate the position function at the endpoints of the interval:
      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle s(1) \amp =\amp -16(1)^2 + 64(1) + 6 = 54 \text{ ft,}\\[0.6em]
\displaystyle s(3) \amp =\amp -16(3)^2 + 64(3) + 6 = 54 \text{ ft.}
\end{array}
      </me>
      Therefore, the displacement is
      <me>
\displaystyle \text{Displacement} = s(3) - s(1) = 54 - 54 = 0 \text{ ft.}
      </me>
      This means that the ball ends up at the same height it started from during this time interval.
    </p>
  </solution>

  <example xml:id="ex-throw-ball-4-seconds">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Under standard gravity <m>g=32</m> ft/sec<sup>2</sup>, suppose a ball is thrown straight up from height
          <m>s_0=5</m> ft. How large must <m>v_0</m> be so that the ball hits the ground after <m>4</m> seconds?
          How high does it go?
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The model is
          <m>s(t)=5+v_0 t-16t^2</m>.
          Landing at <m>t=4</m> means <m>s(4)=0</m>.
        </p>

        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle 0
\amp=\amp \displaystyle s(4)
\\[0.6em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 5+4v_0-16(4^2)
\\[0.8em]
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 5+4v_0-256,
\end{array}
        </me>

        <p>
          so <m>4v_0=251</m> and therefore <m>v_0=62.75</m> ft/sec.
        </p>

        <p>
          The velocity is <m>v(t)=s'(t)=62.75-32t</m>. The ball reaches its highest point when <m>v(t)=0</m>.
        </p>

        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle 0
\amp=\amp \displaystyle 62.75-32t
\\[0.8em]
\amp\Rightarrow\amp \displaystyle t=\frac{62.75}{32}\approx 1.96\ \text{sec}.
\end{array}
        </me>

        <p>
          The height at that time is
          <m>s(1.96)\approx 5+62.75(1.96)-16(1.96)^2\approx 66.5</m> ft.
        </p>

        <p>
          For <m>t&lt;1.96</m> the velocity is positive (the ball rises). For <m>t&gt;1.96</m> the velocity is negative (the ball falls).
        </p>
      </solution>
