    <title>Conceptual Levels of the Derivative</title>

    <p>
      Mathematics solves problems partly with technical tools, but also by translating between different levels of meaning.
      Many problems begin in a physical or geometric setting. We often translate them into a numerical or algebraic setting
      where our tools apply, then translate the result back to the original context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our key concept so far has been the <term>derivative</term>. For a function <m>y=f(x)</m>, the derivative has several
      complementary meanings.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <emph>Physical:</emph> <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)</m> is the rate of change of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.
        For a specific input <m>a</m>, <m>f'(a)</m> describes how fast <m>f(x)</m> changes near <m>x=a</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Geometric:</emph> <m>f'(a)</m> is the slope of the tangent line to the graph <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Numerical:</emph> we approximate the derivative using a difference quotient
        <me>
          f'(a)\cong \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h},
        </me>
        where <m>h</m> is small. As <m>\Delta x=h\to 0</m>, the average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate of change.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Algebraic:</emph> we compute derivatives from formulas using derivative rules and known basic derivatives.
        Occasionally we return to the definition
        <me>
          f'(a)=\displaystyle \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}.
        </me>

  <subsection xml:id="functions-of-motion">
    <title>Functions of Motion</title>

    <p>
      Many applications of derivatives involve motion. In this subsection, all quantities are functions of time <m>t</m>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <emph>Position</emph> (or displacement) <m>s(t)</m>: distance past a reference point (for example, in feet) at time <m>t</m> seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Velocity</emph> <m>v(t)=\displaystyle \frac{ds}{dt}=s'(t)</m>: the rate of change of position (ft/sec). Velocity may be negative.
        <emph>Speed</emph> is <m>|v(t)|</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Acceleration</emph> <m>a(t)=\displaystyle \frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{d^2 s}{dt^2}=s''(t)</m>:
        the rate of change of velocity (ft/sec<sup>2</sup>).
        A useful benchmark is <term>one gee</term>, about <m>32</m> ft/sec<sup>2</sup>, the free-fall acceleration near Earth’s surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <emph>Jerk</emph> <m>j(t)=\displaystyle \frac{da}{dt}=\frac{d^3 s}{dt^3}=s'''(t)</m>:
        the rate of change of acceleration (ft/sec<sup>3</sup>).

  <subsection xml:id="car-stopping">
    <title>Car Stopping</title>

    <p>
      Consider a car whose speedometer data is represented by the velocity graph below.
      Remember: velocity is the derivative of position, so the <emph>level</emph> of <m>v(t)</m> is the <emph>slope</emph> of <m>s(t)</m>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-stop-v-1">
      <caption>Velocity data <m>v(t)</m> from a car’s speedometer.</caption>
      <image source="2-7-Stop-V-1.png" width="85%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Since <m>v(t)=s'(t)</m>, a constant velocity corresponds to a distance graph with constant slope.
      If the velocity suddenly drops to zero, the distance graph becomes flat.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-stop-s-1">
      <caption>Distance <m>s(t)</m> consistent with the velocity graph.</caption>
      <image source="2-7-Stop-S-1.png" width="80%"/>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, <m>a(t)=v'(t)</m>, so the <emph>slope</emph> of the velocity graph becomes the
      <emph>level</emph> of the acceleration graph. The transition is very steep, so the average acceleration over that short time is large.

    <remark xml:id="rem-crash-interpretation">
      <p>
        These graphs describe a car going from about 40 mph to 0 in about 0.1 seconds. That is not normal braking.
        It indicates a crash. The deceleration is roughly <m>\displaystyle \frac{600}{32}\approx 19</m> gees for a brief moment,
        which would feel like many times your weight pressing into the seatbelt.

  <subsection xml:id="braking-techniques">
    <title>Braking Techniques and Jerk</title>

    <p>
      Now imagine braking steadily at a traffic light, slowing at a constant rate until the car stops.
      Here the velocity decreases linearly, and the acceleration is roughly constant.

    <p>
      Even if the deceleration is not large, an abrupt change in acceleration produces a noticeable jolt.
      That jolt corresponds to a large value of jerk for a brief moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      To reduce jerk, the acceleration should change gradually: squeeze the brake down and release it smoothly.
      This makes the acceleration graph rise and fall instead of jumping suddenly.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-stop-a-v-s-3">
      <caption>
        Smoother braking reduces jerk, but it may require a longer stopping time to keep peak deceleration reasonable.

    <remark xml:id="rem-braking-tradeoff">
      <p>
        Smoother changes in acceleration often require a longer stopping distance and time.
        In driving terms: if you want a gentle stop without a jolt, you usually need to begin braking earlier.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Under standard gravity <m>g=32</m> ft/sec<sup>2</sup>, suppose a ball is thrown straight up from height
          <m>s_0=5</m> ft. How large must <m>v_0</m> be so that the ball hits the ground after <m>4</m> seconds?
          How high does it go?

      <solution>
        <p>
          The model is
          <m>s(t)=5+v_0 t-16t^2</m>.
          Landing at <m>t=4</m> means <m>s(4)=0</m>.

\begin{array}{rcl}

          The height at that time is

        <p>
          For <m>t&lt;1.96</m> the velocity is positive (the ball rises). For <m>t&gt;1.96</m> the velocity is negative (the ball falls).
