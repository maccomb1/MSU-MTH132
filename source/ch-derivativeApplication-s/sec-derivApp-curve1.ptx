  <title>Prerequisite Review</title>

<p>A key skill needed for curve sketching is the ability to solve equations and inequalities involving derivatives.
  If you feel a bit out of practice with your inequality solving techniques, it may be helpful
  to revisit those ideas before diving into the calculus.

  <p>
    Derivatives do more than provide slopes at individual points.
    They also reveal the overall shape of a graph.
    In this section, we build a toolkit for sketching the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>
    by analyzing <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>f''(x)</m>.
    The goal is not a perfect drawing, but a reliable picture that captures the key features.

      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> is <term>increasing</term> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> if
          <m>f(x_1)&lt;f(x_2)</m> whenever <m>x_1&lt;x_2</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.

    <p>
      The derivative provides an efficient test: the graph rises where slopes are positive
      and falls where slopes are negative.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-inc-dec">
      <title>Increasing/Decreasing Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f'(x)&gt;0</m> for all <m>x\in(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>[a,b]</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

              If <m>f'(x)&lt;0</m> for all <m>x\in(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is decreasing on <m>[a,b]</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Assume <m>f'(x)&gt;0</m> for all <m>x\in(a,b)</m>, and choose any <m>x_1&lt;x_2</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
          By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists <m>c\in(x_1,x_2)</m> such that
        </p>
        <me>
          f'(c)=\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}.
        </me>
        <p>
          Since <m>x_2-x_1&gt;0</m> and <m>f'(c)&gt;0</m>, we have <m>f(x_2)-f(x_1)&gt;0</m>, so <m>f(x_2)&gt;f(x_1)</m>.
          Therefore <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>[a,b]</m>. The decreasing case is similar.

      <solution> <title>Video Solution</title>
      
      
        <p>
          Here is a video solution to this problem.
        </p>

          <p>
              <video youtube="eYcCeFBrLqc" width="90%">
              </video>

      </solution>
      <solution> <title>Written Solution</title>
      
      
        <p>
          (a) Differentiate:
        </p>

        <me>
          f'(x)=5x^4-45x^2=5x^2(x^2-9)=5x^2(x-3)(x+3).
        </me>

        <p>
          The critical points occur where <m>f'(x)=0</m> (since it is never undefined), so <m>x=-3,0,3</m>.
        </p>
        <p>Since we will need to plot the graph, we should also compute the <m>y</m>-coordinates of the critical points:</p> 
        <me>
          \begin{array}{rcl}
            f(-3) &amp; = &amp; (-3)^5-15(-3)^3  = 162\\
            f(0) &amp; = &amp; 0^5-15\cdot 0^3 = 0\\
            f(3) &amp; = &amp; 3^5-15\cdot 3^3 = -162
          \end{array}
        </me> 
      <p>Now we will use the test point method to determine where <m>f'(x) \gt 0</m> 
          (i.e., where the function is increasing) and where <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> (i.e., where the function is decreasing).</p>

        <p> Choose test points in each of the intervals determined by the critical points: </p> 

        <me>
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
  \text{Interval} &amp; \text{Test Point} &amp; \text{Sign of } f'(x) \\ \hline
 (-\infty,-3) &amp; -4 &amp; (+)(-)(-)\to(+) \\ \hline
(-3,0) &amp; -1 &amp; (+)(-)(+)\to(-) \\ \hline
(0,3) &amp; 1 &amp; (+)(-)(+)\to(-) \\ \hline
(3,\infty) &amp; 4 &amp; (+)(+)(+)\to(+) \\ \hline
\end{array}
</me>

        
        <p><em>Remember:</em> That the value of the derivative at the test point is not important; only the sign matters.
          The sign of <m>f'(x)</m> is determined by the signs of the factors <m>5x^2</m>, <m>(x-3)</m>, and <m>(x+3)</m> (hence 
          the short-hand notation in the table above). </p> 
          
        <p>
          A sign chart is summarized below.
        </p>

        <me>
          \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
          x &amp; -4 &amp; -3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\ \hline
          f'(x) &amp; (+) &amp; 0 &amp; (-) &amp; 0 &amp; (-) &amp; 0 &amp; (+) \\ \hline
          f(x) &amp; \nearrow &amp; 162 &amp; \searrow &amp; 0 &amp; \searrow &amp; -162 &amp; \nearrow
          \end{array}
        </me>

        <p>(b) To sketch the graph we can first plot the critical points and then use the increasing/decreasing behavior to connect them. 
        </p> 

        <p>Here is a good place to start</p> 

<figure xml:id="fig-inc-dec-intervals">

  </shortdescription>
  </image>

</figure>


        <p>And here is a good final sketch. Remember at the critical points the slope is zero so the graph should flatten out near these points. 
          Also polynomial functions are differentiable everywhere so we should not have any sharp corners or cusps.</p>

<figure xml:id="fig-inc-dec-intervals2">

  <image source="images/curvePlot2.PNG" width="85%">
    <shortdescription>
    A graph with vertical dashed lines at x = -3, 0, and 3 dividing the real line into four intervals.
    The leftmost and rightmost regions are labeled INC (increasing), while the two middle regions are labeled DEC (decreasing).
    Points marking critical values are shown on the graph. A curve connects the critical points, rising from the left to the first critical point at (-3, 162), then falling to the second critical point at (0, 0), 
    then falling again to the third critical point at (3, -162), and finally rising again to the right.
  </shortdescription>
  </image>

</figure>


    <p>(c) The function changes from increasing to decreasing at <m>x=-3</m>, so there is a local maximum at <m>x=-3</m>.
          The function changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x=3</m>, so there is a local minimum at <m>x=3</m>.
          At <m>x=0</m>, the derivative is zero but the function is decreasing on both sides, so <m>x=0</m> is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum.
 </p>

        <!--
        <remark xml:id="rem-odd-symmetry">
          <p>
            Since <m>f(x)=x^5-15x^3</m> contains only odd powers, it satisfies <m>f(-x)=-f(x)</m>.
            This means the graph has 180-degree rotational symmetry about the origin.
          </p>
        </remark>
        -->
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p> Now let's formalize the classification of critical points like we did in the last example using the first derivative. </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-first-derivative-test">
      <title>First Derivative Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be differentiable on an interval around <m>c</m> and suppose <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
        </p>
        <ul>

              then <m>x=c</m> is a local maximum.

            <p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
  </subsection>

  <p>So with only the first derivative, we can determine where a function is increasing or decreasing and classify critical points as local maxima, minima, or neither. 
    However, there are other features of the graph that we can analyze using the second derivative. </p>


  <subsection xml:id="ssec-concavity">
    <title>Concavity and Inflection Points</title>

    <p>
      Increasing and decreasing behavior describes whether the graph rises or falls.
      Concavity describes how the graph bends.

    <definition xml:id="def-concavity">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A graph is <term>concave up</term> when it looks like a smile, the curve is bending upwards. The graph is <term>concave down</term>
      when it looks like a frown, the curve is bending downwards.
      An <term>inflection point</term> is a point where the concavity changes.

    <p>
      A helpful way to connect this to derivatives is to think about slopes.
      When a function is concave up, its slopes tend to increase as <m>x</m> increases.
      When a function is concave down, its slopes tend to decrease.

          Here is a video solution to this problem.

      <solution> <title>Written Solution</title>
        <p>
          We already computed <m>f'(x)=5x^4-45x^2</m>. Differentiate again:
        </p>

        <me>
          f''(x)=20x^3-90x=10x(2x^2-9).
        </me>

        <p>
          Candidate inflection points occur where <m>f''(x)=0</m> or where <m>f''(x)</m> is undefined (while <m>f</m> is defined). 
          However since <m>f''(x)</m> is defined for all real <m>x</m>, we only consider where <m>f''(x)=0</m>.
          So either
          <m>10x=0 \implies x=0</m> or <m>2x^2-9=0</m>, which gives <m>x=\pm\dfrac{3}{\sqrt{2}}</m>.
        </p>
        <p> Remember that <m>\sqrt{2}\approx 1.4</m> so the inflection points are approximately at <m>x=-2.1</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x=2.1</m>. </p> 

      <p>Now we will use the test point method to determine where <m>f''(x) \gt 0</m> 
          (i.e., where the function is concave up) and where <m>f''(x) \lt 0</m> (i.e., where the function is concave down).</p>

        <p> Choose test points in each of the intervals and check the sign of <m>f''(x)=(2x^2-9)</m>:  </p> 

        <me>
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
  \text{Interval} &amp; \text{Test Point} &amp; \text{Sign of } f''(x) \\ \hline
 (-\infty,-\tfrac{3}{\sqrt{2}}) &amp; -4 &amp; (-)(+) \to (-) \\ \hline
(-\tfrac{3}{\sqrt{2}},0) &amp; -1 &amp; (-)(-)\to(+) \\ \hline
(0,\tfrac{3}{\sqrt{2}}) &amp; 1 &amp; (+)(-)\to(-) \\ \hline
(\tfrac{3}{\sqrt{2}},\infty) &amp; 4 &amp; (+)(+)\to(+) \\ \hline
\end{array}
</me>

  <p>So therefore <m>f</m> is concave down on <m>(-\infty,-\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}) \cup (0,\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}})</m>,

      <solution>
        <title>Written Solution</title>
        <p> (a) The y-intercept occurs at <m>f(0)=0</m>. Setting <m>f(x)=0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>, we find that <m>x=0</m> is the only <m>x</m>-intercept. 
          There is a vertical asymptote at <m>x=1</m> since the denominator is zero there and the numerator is not. 
          To find horizontal asymptotes, we compute limits as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>. 
          We can use dominant term analysis to find that 
          
          <me>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} f(x) \approx \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} \dfrac{x^{2/3}}{x^2} = \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} x^{-4/3} = 0</me> 
          
          so there is a horizontal asymptote at <m>y=0</m>. 
        </p> 
        <p> (b) To find critical points, we first compute the derivative using the quotient rule: </p>
        <me>
          \begin{array}{rcl}
            f'(x) &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{(x^{2/3})'(x-1)^2 - x^{2/3}((x-1)^2)'}{(x-1)^4} \\
            &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}(x-1)^2 - x^{2/3}\cdot 2(x-1)}{(x-1)^4} \\
            &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}(x-1) - 2x^{2/3}}{(x-1)^3} \\
            &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{2x^{-1/3}(x-1) - 6x^{2/3}}{3(x-1)^3}\\
            &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{2x^{-1/3}(x-1) - 6x^{2/3}}{3(x-1)^3} \cdot \frac{x^{1/3}}{x^{1/3}} \\
            &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{2(x-1) - 6x}{3x^{1/3}(x-1)^3} \\
            &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-4x-2}{3x^{1/3}(x-1)^3}
          \end{array}
        </me>

        <p>
          The critical points occur where <m>f'(x)=0</m> or where <m>f'(x)</m> is undefined (while <m>f</m> is defined). 
          Since the denominator is zero at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>, we know <m>x=0</m> is a critical point (but <m>x=1</m> is not, since <m>f</m> is undefined there). 
          We also set the numerator equal to zero and solve for <m>x</m> to find other critical points:
          <me>
            -4x-2=0 \implies x=-\frac{1}{2}.
          </me>
          So the critical points are at <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>x=0</m>.
        </p>
        <p> 
          To determine where <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing, we can use the test point method to check the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> in each
          interval determined by the critical points and vertical asymptote:
        </p> 
        <me>
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
  \text{Interval} &amp; \text{Test Point} &amp; \text{Sign of } f'(x) \\ \hline
 (-\infty,-\frac{1}{2}) &amp; -1 &amp; \frac{(+)}{(-)(-)} \to (+) \\ \hline
(-\frac{1}{2},0) &amp; -\frac{1}{4} &amp; \frac{(-)}{(-)(-)} \to (-) \\ \hline
(0,1) &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{(-)}{(+)(-)} \to (+) \\ \hline
(1,\infty) &amp; 2 &amp; \frac{(-)}{(+)(+)} \to (-) \\ \hline
\end{array}
</me>
  <p>
    So <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(-\infty,-\frac{1}{2}) \cup (0,1)</m> and decreasing on <m>(-\frac{1}{2},0) \cup (1,\infty)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>(c) To determine concavity, we compute the second derivative. We can use the quotient rule again, or we can differentiate the expression we found for <m>f'(x)</m>.
    We will use the quotient rule on the expression for <m>f'(x)</m> to practice that skill again. To make the derivative a bit easier 
    to compute, we will first write 
  </p>
  <me> 
    f'(x) = \dfrac{-4x-2}{3x^{1/3}(x-1)^3} = \dfrac{-2}{3}\cdot \dfrac{2x^{2/3}+x^{-1/3}}{(x-1)^3} 
  </me>
  <p>Taking the derivative, we get:</p>
  <me>
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    f''(x) &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{(2x^{2/3}+x^{-1/3})'(x-1)^3 - (2x^{2/3}+x^{-1/3})((x-1)^3)'}{(x-1)^6} \\
    &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{(\frac{4}{3}x^{-1/3}-\frac{1}{3}x^{-4/3})(x-1)^3 - (2x^{2/3}+x^{-1/3})(3(x-1)^2)}{(x-1)^6} \\
    &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{(\frac{4}{3}x^{-1/3}-\frac{1}{3}x^{-4/3})(x-1) - (2x^{2/3}+x^{-1/3})(3)}{(x-1)^4} \\
    &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{\frac{4}{3}x^{-1/3}(x-1) -\frac{1}{3}x^{-4/3}(x-1) - 6x^{2/3} - 3x^{-1/3}}{(x-1)^4} \\
    &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{\frac{4}{3}x^{-1/3}(x-1) -\frac{1}{3}x^{-4/3}(x-1) - 6x^{2/3} - 3x^{-1/3}}{(x-1)^4} \cdot \frac{3x^{4/3}}{3x^{4/3}} \\
    &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{4x(x-1) - (x-1) - 18x^2 - 9x}{3x^{4/3}(x-1)^4} \\
    &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{3} \cdot \dfrac{-14x^2 -14x +1}{3x^{4/3}(x-1)^4} \\
      &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{2}{9} \cdot \dfrac{14x^2 + 14x -1}{x^{4/3}(x-1)^4}
\end{array}
  </me>
  <p>
    Candidate inflection points occur where <m>f''(x)=0</m> or where <m>f''(x)</m> is undefined (while <m>f</m> is defined). 
    Since <m>f''(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>, we know <m>x=0</m> is a possible inflection point (but <m>x=1</m> is not, since <m>f</m> is undefined there). 
  </p>
  <p> We also set the numerator equal to zero and solve for <m>x</m> to find other candidates: </p>
  <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
14x^2 + 14x -1 &amp; = &amp; 0 \\
x &amp; = &amp; \frac{-14 \pm \sqrt{14^2 - 4\cdot 14 \cdot (-1)}}{2\cdot 14} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{-14 \pm \sqrt{196 + 56}}{28} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{-14 \pm \sqrt{252}}{28} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{-14 \pm 6\sqrt{7}}{28} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{-1}{2} \pm \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{14}
\end{array}
  </me>
  <p>Since <m>\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{14} \approx 0.5</m>, the candidates from the numerator are approximately at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=0</m>. </p>

        <title>Written Solution</title>
        <p>(a) The <m>y</m>-intercept occurs at <m>f(0)=\frac{-1}{2}</m>. Setting <m>f(x)=0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>, we find:
          <me>
            \begin{array}{rcl}
              0 &amp; = &amp; x+\dfrac{1}{x+1}-\dfrac{3}{2} \\
              2(x+1) (0) &amp; = &amp; 2(x+1) ( x+\dfrac{1}{x+1} - \dfrac{3}{2} ) \\
              0 &amp; = &amp; 2x(x+1) + 2 - 3(x+1) \\
              0 &amp; = &amp; 2x^2 + 2x + 2 - 3x - 3 \\
              0 &amp; = &amp; 2x^2 - x - 1 \\
              0 &amp; = &amp; (2x+1)(x-1)
              \end{array}
          </me>
            so the <m>x</m>-intercepts are at <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>x=1</m>. </p> 
            <p>  There is a vertical asymptote at <m>x=-1</m> since the denominator of the rational part is zero there and the numerator is not. 
          To find horizontal asymptotes, we compute limits as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>. 
          We can use dominant term analysis to find that
          <me>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} f(x) \approx \lim_{x\to\pm\infty} x = \pm\infty</me>
          so there are no horizontal asymptotes.
            </p>
            <p>(b) To find critical points, we first compute the derivative: </p>
        <me>
          f'(x) = 1 - \dfrac{1}{(x+1)^2} = \dfrac{(x+1)^2 - 1}{(x+1)^2} = \dfrac{x^2 + 2x}{(x+1)^2}.
        </me> 
        <p>
          The critical points occur where <m>f'(x)=0</m> or where <m>f'(x)</m> is undefined (while <m>f</m> is defined). 
          Since <m>f'(x)</m> only undefined when <m>x=-1</m> (since the denominator is zero there), and <m>f</m> is undefined at <m>x=-1</m>, 
          we only consider where <m>f'(x)=0</m>.
          Setting the derivative equal to zero and solving for <m>x</m>, we find:
          <me>
            \begin{array}{rcl}
              0 &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{x^2 + 2x}{(x+1)^2} \\
              0 &amp; = &amp; x^2+2x \\
              0 &amp; = &amp; x(x+2)
              \end{array}
          </me>
          so the critical points are at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=-2</m>.            
        </p>
        <p> 
          To determine where <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing, we can use the test point method to check the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> in each
          interval determined by the critical points and vertical asymptote:
        </p> 
        <me>
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
  \text{Interval} &amp; \text{Test Point} &amp; \text{Sign of } f'(x) \\ \hline
 (-\infty,-2) &amp; -3 &amp; \dfrac{(-)(-)}{(+)} \to (+) \\ \hline
(-2,-1) &amp; -\frac{3}{2} &amp; \dfrac{(-)(+)}{(+)} \to (-) \\ \hline
(-1,0) &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; \dfrac{(-)(+)}{(+)} \to (-) \\ \hline
(0,\infty) &amp; 1 &amp; \dfrac{(+)(+)}{(+)} \to (+)
\end{array}
</me>
<p>  So <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(-\infty,-2) \cup (0,\infty)</m> and decreasing on <m>(-2,-1) \cup (-1,0)</m>. </p>
<p>(c) To determine concavity, we compute the second derivative: </p>
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
f''(x) &amp; = &amp; \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{(x+1)^2}\right)' \\
&amp; = &amp; 0 - \dfrac{2}{(x+1)^3}
\end{array}
</me>
<p>
Candidate inflection points occur where <m>f''(x)=0</m> or where <m>f''(x)</m> is undefined (while <m>f</m> is defined). 
Since <m>f''(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=-1</m>, we do not consider that point since <m>f</m> is also undefined there. 
Setting the second derivative equal to zero and solving for <m>x</m>, we find:
</p>
<me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
0 &amp; = &amp; \dfrac{-2}{(x+1)^3} \\
0 &amp; = &amp; -2
\end{array}
</me>
<p> 
Since there is no value of <m>x</m> that makes <m>f''(x)=0</m>, there are no inflection points.
</p>
<p>  To determine where <m>f</m> is concave up or concave down, we can use the test point method to check the sign of <m>f''(x)</m> in each
          interval determined by the vertical asymptote:
</p>
<me>
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
  \text{Interval} &amp; \text{Test Point} &amp; \text{Sign of } f''(x) \\ \hline
 (-\infty,-1) &amp; -2 &amp; \dfrac{-2}{(-)} \to (+) \\ \hline
(-1,\infty) &amp; 0 &amp; \dfrac{-2}{(+)} \to (-) \\ \hline 
\end{array}
</me>
<p>
So <m>f</m> is concave up on <m>(-\infty,-1)</m> and concave down on <m>(-1,\infty)</m>.
</p>
<p>(d) We can now combine all of this information to sketch the graph of <m>f</m>. First I would plot the intercepts, asymptotes, and critical points. 
  Then I would use the intervals of increase/decrease and concavity to determine the shape of the graph in each region.
</p>

<shortdescription>
A coordinate plane showing a curve labeled f(x). 
The curve is increasing from left to right and gradually flattening, 
meaning its slope is positive but decreasing as x increases. 
The graph bends downward, indicating it is concave down. A solid point is marked on the curve directly above x equals 2, 
with a dashed vertical line dropping from the point to the x-axis at 2.

      <p>While these True / False problems are good for quickly testing your understanding of the concepts, 
    you should also practice applying these ideas to more complicated and complete problems (like those that appear on WeBWork) 
    and can possibly appear on quizzes and exams.
