      <li>Use the First Derivative Test to classify critical points as local maxima, local minima, or stationary points.</li>

  <p>
    Derivatives do more than provide slopes at individual points.
    They also reveal the overall shape of a graph.
    In this section, we build a toolkit for sketching the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>
    by analyzing <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>f''(x)</m>.
    The goal is not a perfect drawing, but a reliable picture that captures the key features.

        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> is <term>increasing</term> on an interval <m>[a,b]</m> if

      The derivative provides an efficient test: the graph rises where slopes are positive
      and falls where slopes are negative.

      <proof>
        <p>
          Assume <m>f'(x)&gt;0</m> for all <m>x\in(a,b)</m>, and choose any <m>x_1&lt;x_2</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>.
          By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists <m>c\in(x_1,x_2)</m> such that

        <me>
          f'(c)=\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}.
        </me>
        <p>
          Since <m>x_2-x_1&gt;0</m> and <m>f'(c)&gt;0</m>, we have <m>f(x_2)-f(x_1)&gt;0</m>, so <m>f(x_2)&gt;f(x_1)</m>.
          Therefore <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>[a,b]</m>. The decreasing case is similar.

          Let <m>f(x)=x^5-15x^3</m>.

        <p>
          The critical points occur where <m>f'(x)=0</m>, so <m>x=-3,0,3</m>.
          To determine the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> on the intervals between critical points,
          we test one value in each interval.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since <m>5x^2\ge 0</m>, the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> is controlled by <m>(x-3)(x+3)</m>
          except that <m>x=0</m> contributes a zero but does not change sign.

        <p>
          The function changes from increasing to decreasing at <m>x=-3</m>,
          so there is a local maximum at <m>x=-3</m>.
          The function changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x=3</m>,
          so there is a local minimum at <m>x=3</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <m>x=0</m>, the derivative is zero but the function is decreasing on both sides,
          so <m>x=0</m> is a stationary point rather than a local extremum.

            This means the graph has 180-degree rotational symmetry about the origin.

    <title>Concavity and Inflection Points</title>

    <p>
      Increasing and decreasing behavior describes whether the graph rises or falls.
      Concavity describes how the graph bends.
      A graph is <term>concave up</term> when it looks like a smile, and <term>concave down</term>
      when it looks like a frown.
      An <term>inflection point</term> is a point where the concavity changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      A helpful way to connect this to derivatives is to think about slopes.
      When a function is concave up, its slopes tend to increase as <m>x</m> increases.
      When a function is concave down, its slopes tend to decrease.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-concavity-test">

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>f''(x)&lt;0</m> for all <m>x\in(a,b)</m>, then <m>f</m> is concave down on <m>(a,b)</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          Apply the Increasing/Decreasing Test to <m>g(x)=f'(x)</m>.
          If <m>g'(x)&gt;0</m>, then <m>g</m> is increasing.
          Since <m>g'(x)=(f'(x))'=f''(x)</m>, the condition <m>f''(x)&gt;0</m> means <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing,
          which corresponds to concave up behavior. The concave down case is similar,
          and the inflection point criterion follows from a sign change in <m>f''</m>.

          Candidate inflection points occur where <m>f''(x)=0</m>, so

        <p>
          A sign check for <m>f''(x)</m> shows that concavity changes at each of these points,
          so they are inflection points.
          In particular, the graph is concave down for large negative <m>x</m>,
          then concave up between <m>-\frac{3}{\sqrt2}</m> and <m>0</m>,

    <title>A Longer Example</title>

    <example xml:id="ex-curvesketch-rational">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Sketch the graph of
          <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^{2/3}}{(x-1)^2}</m>.
          Identify intercepts, critical points, intervals of increase/decrease,
          concavity, inflection points, and any vertical asymptotes.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The function is defined for all real <m>x</m> except <m>x=1</m>.
          Also note <m>f(0)=0</m>, so the graph passes through the origin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using derivative rules (and simplifying), we obtain:
        </p>

        <me>
          f'(x)=-\frac{\tfrac{2}{3}(2x+1)}{(x-1)^3x^{1/3}},
          \qquad
          f''(x)=-\frac{\tfrac{2}{9}(14x^2+14x-1)}{(x-1)^4x^{4/3}}.
        </me>

        <p>
          Critical points occur where <m>f'(x)=0</m> or where <m>f'(x)</m> is undefined (while <m>f</m> is defined).
          The equation <m>f'(x)=0</m> is satisfied when <m>2x+1=0</m>, so <m>x=-\frac12</m>.
          The derivative is undefined at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
          Since <m>f(1)</m> is undefined, <m>x=1</m> is a vertical asymptote of the function.
          Since <m>f(0)</m> is defined but the derivative is not, <m>x=0</m> is a critical point.
        </p>

        <p>
          A sign analysis for <m>f'(x)</m> shows:
        </p>

        <me>
          \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
          x &amp; \quad &amp; -\frac12 &amp; \quad &amp; 0 &amp; \quad &amp; 1 \ \ \ \\ \hline
          f'(x) &amp; + &amp; 0 &amp; - &amp; \text{undef} &amp; + &amp; \text{undef} \ \ - \\
          \hline
          f(x) &amp; \nearrow &amp; &amp; \searrow &amp; &amp; \nearrow &amp; \text{VA} \ \searrow
          \end{array}
        </me>

        <p>
          Therefore <m>x=-\frac12</m> is a local maximum.
          At <m>x=0</m>, the graph has a cusp: the function reaches a local minimum at the origin,
          but the tangent line is vertical rather than horizontal.
          At <m>x=1</m>, there is a vertical asymptote, and the function grows without bound as <m>x\to 1^\pm</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inflection points occur where <m>f''(x)=0</m> and concavity changes.
          Solve <m>14x^2+14x-1=0</m>:
        </p>

        <me>
          x=\frac{-14\pm\sqrt{14^2-4(14)(-1)}}{2(14)}
          =\frac{-14\pm 6\sqrt7}{28}
          =\frac{-7\pm 3\sqrt7}{14}.
        </me>

        <p>
          These values (approximately <m>-1.07</m> and <m>0.07</m>) are candidates,
          and checking concavity confirms that the concavity changes at both, so they are inflection points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, as <m>|x|\to\infty</m>, the factors <m>x</m> and <m>x-1</m> are nearly the same,
          so we compare with
        </p>

        <me>
          f(x)=\frac{x^{2/3}}{(x-1)^2}\approx\frac{x^{2/3}}{x^2}=x^{-4/3}.
        </me>

        <p>
          This shows <m>f(x)\to 0</m> as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>.
          Combining these features produces a reliable sketch.
