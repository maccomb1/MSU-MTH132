  <title>Curve Sketching Part 2</title>
   <objectives>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain why qualitative graphing is useful even when graphing technology is available.</li>
      <li>Use end behavior ideas (limits and leading-term comparisons) to understand how a graph behaves for large <m>|x|</m>.</li>
      <li>Use derivative sign charts to classify behavior near critical points and vertical asymptotes.</li>
      <li>Recognize and use symmetry (even, odd, periodic, and other transformations) to streamline a sketch.</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>

  <p>
    At this point, you may be asking, "<em>Why do I need to learn to sketch graphs by hand 
      when there are computers and calculators that can graph instantly?</em>"
    One reason is that calculus helps us focus on the important parts of the graph: critical points,
    asymptotes, and regions where behavior changes. Another reason is error checking. A quick sketch,
    combined with a few well-chosen test values, can reveal when a result is unreasonable long before
    a mistake spreads into a larger calculation. Finally, sketching by hand is a skill that can be useful in many contexts, 
    such as when you are explaining a graph to someone else, or when you are trying to understand a graph that is already drawn.
  </p>

  <p> So in this section, we first learn a few more skills to aid our curve sketching abilities. Then we will 
    work through several longer problems that apply the full curve sketching method.

    <title>The Second Derivative Test</title>

    <p>
      The First Derivative Test classifies critical points by checking whether <m>f'(x)</m> changes sign.
      When <m>f''(c)</m> exists, there is a quicker classification that often works.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-second-derivative-test">
      <title>Second Derivative Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be twice differentiable near <m>c</m>, and suppose <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If <m>f''(c)&gt;0</m>, then <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=c</m>.</p>

          <li>
            <p>If <m>f''(c)&lt;0</m>, then <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=c</m>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If <m>f''(c)=0</m>, then the test is inconclusive.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <remark xml:id="rem-sdt-inconclusive">
      <p>
        If <m>f''(c)=0</m>, the point could still be a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither.
        In that case, you should return to the First Derivative Test (or another method).
      </p>
    </remark>

    <example xml:id="ex-second-derivative-test">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the Second Derivative Test to classify the critical points of <m>f(x)=x^3-3x^2+4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Doing some prep work, the derivatives are
          <m>f'(x)=3x^2-6x</m> and <m>f''(x)=6x-6</m>.
          Now to find the critical points, we set <m>f'(x)=0</m>, which gives <m>3x^2-6x=0</m>.
          Factoring gives <m>3x(x-2)=0</m>, so the critical points are <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
          Note that <m>f'(x)</m> is defined everywhere, so there are no critical points from undefined derivatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Evaluating the second derivative at these points gives
          <m>f''(0)=-6&lt;0</m>, so there is a local maximum at <m>x=0</m>, and
          <m>f''(2)=6&gt;0</m>, so there is a local minimum at <m>x=2</m>.

 <subsection xml:id="ssec-symmetry">
    <title>Symmetry</title>

    <p>
      Sometimes symmetry can dramatically reduce the work needed to sketch a graph.
      If you can recognize that a function is even or odd, then you can often
      sketch a smaller portion of the graph and use symmetry to complete the picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the idea of symmetry was first introduced in an algebraic context in the section on functions, 
      but here we are using it as a tool for graphing.

        <p>
          Here is a video solution to this problem.
        </p>

          <p>
              <video youtube="eYcCeFBrLqc" width="90%">
              </video>
          </p>
      </solution>

      <solution>
        <title>Written Solution</title>

        <p> (a) There are no vertical asymptotes since the domain is all real numbers. 
          There are no horizontal asymptotes since the function grows without bound as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          The function is odd since, 
          <me> 
s(-x)=-x-2\sin(-x)=-x+2\sin(x)=-(x-2\sin(x))=-s(x).</me>          
          so it has 180-degree rotational symmetry about the origin.
          </p>
        
        <p> (b) 
          The derivative is
          <m>s'(x)=1-2\cos(x)</m>. This is always defined, so there are no critical points from undefined derivatives. 
          So we only need to solve <m>s'(x)=0</m> to find critical points.
          <me> \begin{array}{rcl}
 0 \amp =\amp  1-2\cos(x)  \\
  \cos(x)\amp = \amp \tfrac12 \\
  x \amp= \amp\tfrac{-5\pi}{3}, \tfrac{-\pi}{3}, \tfrac{\pi}{3}, \tfrac{5\pi}{3}
\end{array} </me> 
</p>
  <p> Note that the symmetry of the function means that the critical points are symmetric about the origin, 
    and the behavior on <m>[-2\pi,0]</m> is a mirror image of the behavior on <m>[0,2\pi]</m>.
  </p> 
  <p> Choosing test points in each interval determined by the critical points gives the following sign chart for <m>s'(x)</m>:</p>
  <me> \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    x \amp \text{Sign of } s'(x) \amp \text{Behavior of } s(x) \\
    \hline
    -2\pi \amp (-) \amp \text{decreasing} \\
    -\tfrac{5\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    -\pi \amp (+) \amp \text{increasing} \\
    -\tfrac{\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    0 \amp (-) \amp \text{decreasing} \\
    \tfrac{\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    \pi \amp (+) \amp \text{increasing} \\
    \tfrac{5\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    2\pi \amp (-) \amp \text{decreasing}
  \end{array}
</me>
<p> So the function is decreasing on <m>[-2\pi,-\tfrac{5\pi}{3}) \cup (-\tfrac{\pi}{3},\tfrac{\pi}{3}) \cup (\tfrac{5\pi}{3},2\pi]</m>, 
  and increasing on <m>(-\tfrac{5\pi}{3},-\tfrac{\pi}{3}) \cup (\tfrac{\pi}{3},\tfrac{5\pi}{3})</m>. </p>

  <p> Again we could have used the symmetry of the function to reduce our work. 
    For instance, we could have just analyzed the behavior on <m>[0,2\pi]</m> and then used symmetry to get the rest of our conclusion. </p>

    <p>(c) The second derivative is <m>s''(x)=2\sin(x)</m>, which is defined everywhere, so there are no inflection points from undefined derivatives.
         To find inflection points, we solve <m>s''(x)=0</m>, which gives <m>\sin(x)=0</m>.
         This happens at <m>x= -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi</m>. Because <m> x=-2\pi</m> and <m>x=2\pi</m> are endpoints of the interval, 
         they cannot be inflection points, so the only possible inflection points are at <m>x=-\pi,0,\pi</m>.
    </p>
    <p> To determine intervals of concavity, we can use test points in each interval determined by the possible inflection points.
      This gives the following sign chart for <m>s''(x)</m>:</p>
  <me> \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    x \amp \text{Sign of } s''(x) \amp \text{Concavity of } s(x) \\
    \hline
    -2\pi \amp 0 \amp  \\
    -\tfrac{3\pi}{2} \amp (+) \amp \text{concave up} \\
    -\pi \amp 0 \amp  \\
    -\tfrac{\pi}{2} \amp (-) \amp \text{concave down} \\
    0 \amp 0 \amp  \\
    \tfrac{\pi}{2} \amp (+) \amp \text{concave up} \\
    \pi \amp 0 \amp   \\
    \tfrac{3\pi}{2} \amp (-) \amp \text{concave down} \\
    2\pi \amp 0 \amp  
  \end{array}
</me>
<p> So the function is concave up on <m>(-2\pi,-\pi) \cup (0,\pi)</m> and concave down on <m>(-\pi,0) \cup (\pi,2\pi)</m>. </p>
    
<p>(d) Combining all of this information, we can sketch the graph of <m>s</m>.
  We know there are no asymptotes, and the function is odd, so we can focus on sketching the portion of the graph on <m>[0,2\pi]</m> 
  and then use symmetry to get the rest of the graph.</p>
  <p> Since we will need to plot all critical points and inflection points, we should compute the function values at these points. 
  </p>
    <me> \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    x \amp s(x) \amp \text{Type of Point} \\
\hline
0 \amp 0 \amp \text{inflection point} \\
\tfrac{\pi}{3} \amp \tfrac{\pi}{3}-\sqrt{3}\approx -0.7  \amp \text{critical point} \\
\pi \amp \pi \amp \text{inflection point} \\
\tfrac{5\pi}{3} \amp \tfrac{5\pi}{3}+\sqrt{3}\approx 6.7 \amp \text{critical point} \\

      <exercise xml:id="tf-cs2-01">
        <statement>
          <p>
            True or False: A calculator graph can hide important features if the viewing window is not chosen carefully.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <emph>True.</emph> A window can miss a vertical asymptote, a local extremum, or a change in concavity.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <exercise xml:id="tf-cs2-02">
        <statement>
          <p>
            True or False: If <m>f(x)\approx cx^p</m> for large <m>|x|</m>, then this approximation can help predict the end behavior of the graph.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <emph>True.</emph> The dominant term controls the long-range trend.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </exercise>

      <exercise xml:id="tf-cs2-03">
        <statement>
          <p>
            True or False: If <m>f</m> is odd, then its graph has 180-degree rotational symmetry about the origin.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <emph>True.</emph> This follows from <m>f(-x)=-f(x)</m>.

      <exercise xml:id="prob-cs2-rational-sketch">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Analyze <m>\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{x(x-3)}</m>.
            Identify the domain, intercepts, vertical asymptotes, end behavior, and intervals of increase/decrease.
            Then sketch a graph.
          </p>
        </statement>

      <exercise xml:id="prob-cs2-leading-terms">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Use leading-term comparisons to describe the end behavior of:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p><m>\displaystyle f(x)=\frac{5x^3-2x+7}{x^2+1}</m></p></li>
            <li><p><m>\displaystyle g(x)=\frac{3x^2-10}{2x^4+1}</m></p></li>

      <exercise xml:id="prob-cs2-trig">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>g(x)=x+\sin(x)</m>.
            Find <m>g'(x)</m> and <m>g''(x)</m>, describe where the graph is concave up or concave down,
            and determine whether the function is even, odd, or neither.

      <exercise xml:id="prob-cs2-window">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Give an example of a function whose graph has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=1</m>.
            Explain how a poorly chosen viewing window could make it look like the function is continuous.
