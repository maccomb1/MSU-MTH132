  <title>Curve Sketching Part 2</title>
  <objectives>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain why qualitative graphing is useful even when graphing technology is available.</li>
      <li>Use end behavior ideas (limits and leading-term comparisons) to understand how a graph behaves for large <m>|x|</m>.</li>
      <li>Use derivative sign charts to classify behavior near critical points and vertical asymptotes.</li>
      <li>Recognize and use symmetry (even, odd, periodic, and other transformations) to streamline a sketch.</li>
    </ul>
  </objectives>

  <p>
    Computers can produce a graph instantly by plotting many points, so why learn to sketch by hand?
    One reason is that calculus helps us focus on the important parts of the graph: critical points,
    asymptotes, and regions where behavior changes. Another reason is error checking. A quick sketch,
    combined with a few well-chosen test values, can reveal when a result is unreasonable long before
    a mistake spreads into a larger calculation.

  <subsection xml:id="ssec-rational-example">
    <title>A Rational Function Example</title>

    <example xml:id="ex-curve-rational">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the curve sketching method to analyze
          <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^3-6x^2+11x-6}{2x^2-8x}</m>.
          Identify the domain, intercepts, critical points, vertical asymptotes, an inflection point, and end behavior.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          First factor the function:
        </p>

        <me>
          f(x)=\frac{x^3-6x^2+11x-6}{2x^2-8x}
          =\frac{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)}{2x(x-4)}.
        </me>

        <p>
          The domain excludes values that make the denominator zero, so
          <m>x\neq 0</m> and <m>x\neq 4</m>. These produce vertical asymptotes at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=4</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Intercepts come from <m>f(x)=0</m>, which occurs at zeros of the numerator that are in the domain:
          <m>x=1,2,3</m>. There is no <m>y</m>-intercept because <m>x=0</m> is not in the domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          The derivatives (after simplification) are:
        </p>

        <me>
          f'(x)=\frac{x^4-8x^3+13x^2+12x-24}{2x^2(x-4)^2},
          \qquad
          f''(x)=-\frac{3(x^3-6x^2+24x-32)}{x^3(x-4)^3}.
        </me>

        <p>
          Solving <m>f'(x)=0</m> requires locating roots of the numerator.
          A numerical approach (graphing or a root finder) gives approximate solutions:
        </p>

        <me>
          a_1\approx -1.26,\quad a_2\approx 1.39,\quad a_3\approx 2.61,\quad a_4\approx 5.26.
        </me>

        <p>
          Along with the vertical asymptotes at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=4</m>, these break the real line into intervals
          where the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> is constant. A sign chart then determines where the function increases or decreases,
          which in turn classifies the critical points as local maxima or minima.
        </p>

        <p>
          For concavity, solve <m>f''(x)=0</m> by setting the numerator to zero:
        </p>

        <me>
          x^3-6x^2+24x-32=0.
        </me>

        <p>
          Factoring shows
          <m>x^3-6x^2+24x-32=(x-2)(x^2-4x+16)</m>, and the quadratic has no real roots.
          Thus <m>x=2</m> is the only inflection point in the domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, to understand end behavior, compare leading terms:
        </p>

        <me>
          f(x)=\frac{x^3-6x^2+11x-6}{2x^2-8x}\approx \frac{x^3}{2x^2}=\tfrac12 x \quad \text{for large } |x|.
        </me>

        <p>
          This tells us that the graph grows roughly like a line with slope <m>\tfrac12</m> as <m>|x|</m> becomes large.
          In practice, this is enough to guide a reasonable sketch when combined with critical points and asymptotes.

  <subsection xml:id="ssec-trig-example">
    <title>A Trigonometric Example</title>

    <example xml:id="ex-curve-trig">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Apply the curve sketching method to <m>s(x)=x-2\sin(x)</m>.
          Identify critical points, concavity, intercepts, and symmetry.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The derivatives are
          <m>s'(x)=1-2\cos(x)</m> and <m>s''(x)=2\sin(x)</m>.
          The domain is all real numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Critical points occur where <m>s'(x)=0</m>, so <m>\cos(x)=\tfrac12</m>.
          This happens at <m>x=\tfrac{\pi}{3}</m> and <m>x=\tfrac{5\pi}{3}</m>, repeating every <m>2\pi</m>:
        </p>

        <me>
          x=\tfrac{\pi}{3}+2\pi n
          \quad\text{and}\quad
          x=\tfrac{5\pi}{3}+2\pi n
          \quad\text{for integers } n.
        </me>

        <p>
          Inflection points occur where <m>s''(x)=0</m>, so <m>\sin(x)=0</m>, which gives
          <m>x=n\pi</m> for any integer <m>n</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The point <m>(0,s(0))=(0,0)</m> is both an <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-intercept.
        </p>

        <p>
          This function is odd:
          <m>s(-x)=-x-2\sin(-x)=-x+2\sin(x)=-(x-2\sin(x))=-s(x)</m>.
          Therefore its graph has 180-degree rotational symmetry about the origin.
        </p>

        <remark xml:id="rem-trig-end-behavior">
          <p>
            Since <m>s(x)=x-2\sin(x)</m> behaves like <m>x</m> for large <m>|x|</m>, a reasonable long-range guide is the line <m>y=x</m>.
            However, the term <m>-2\sin(x)</m> keeps oscillating, so the graph continues to wiggle above and below this line.
