  <p>
    At this point, you may be asking, "<em>Why do I need to learn to sketch graphs by hand 
      when there are computers and calculators that can graph instantly?</em>"
    One reason is that calculus helps us focus on the important parts of the graph: critical points,
    asymptotes, and regions where behavior changes. Another reason is error checking. A quick sketch,
    combined with a few well-chosen test values, can reveal when a result is unreasonable long before
    a mistake spreads into a larger calculation. Finally, sketching by hand is a skill that can be useful in many contexts, 
    such as when you are explaining a graph to someone else, or when you are trying to understand a graph that is already drawn.
  </p>

  <p> So in this section, we first learn a few more skills to aid our curve sketching abilities. Then we will 
    work through several longer problems that apply the full curve sketching method.

 <subsection xml:id="ssec-second-derivative-test">
    <title>The Second Derivative Test</title>

    <p>
      The First Derivative Test classifies critical points by checking whether <m>f'(x)</m> changes sign.
      When <m>f''(c)</m> exists, there is a quicker classification that often works.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-second-derivative-test">
      <title>Second Derivative Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be twice differentiable near <m>c</m>, and suppose <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If <m>f''(c)&gt;0</m>, then <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=c</m>.</p>

          <li>
            <p>If <m>f''(c)&lt;0</m>, then <m>f</m> has a local maximum at <m>x=c</m>.</p>

          <li>
            <p>If <m>f''(c)=0</m>, then the test is inconclusive.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <remark xml:id="rem-sdt-inconclusive">
      <p>
        If <m>f''(c)=0</m>, the point could still be a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither.
        In that case, you should return to the First Derivative Test (or another method).
      </p>
    </remark>

    <example xml:id="ex-second-derivative-test">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use the Second Derivative Test to classify the critical points of <m>f(x)=x^3-3x^2+4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Doing some prep work, the derivatives are
          <m>f'(x)=3x^2-6x</m> and <m>f''(x)=6x-6</m>.
          Now to find the critical points, we set <m>f'(x)=0</m>, which gives <m>3x^2-6x=0</m>.
          Factoring gives <m>3x(x-2)=0</m>, so the critical points are <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
          Note that <m>f'(x)</m> is defined everywhere, so there are no critical points from undefined derivatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Evaluating the second derivative at these points gives
          <m>f''(0)=-6&lt;0</m>, so there is a local maximum at <m>x=0</m>, and
          <m>f''(2)=6&gt;0</m>, so there is a local minimum at <m>x=2</m>.

 <subsection xml:id="ssec-symmetry">
    <title>Symmetry</title>

    <p>
      Sometimes symmetry can dramatically reduce the work needed to sketch a graph.
      If you can recognize that a function is even or odd, then you can often
      sketch a smaller portion of the graph and use symmetry to complete the picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the idea of symmetry was first introduced in an algebraic context in the section on functions, 
      but here we are using it as a tool for graphing.

        <p>
          Here is a video solution to this problem.
        </p>

          <p>

              </video>
          </p>
      </solution>

      <solution>
        <title>Written Solution</title>

        <p> (a) There are no vertical asymptotes since the domain is all real numbers. 
          There are no horizontal asymptotes since the function grows without bound as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          The function is odd since, 
          <me> \begin{array}{rcl}
s(-x) \amp =\amp -x-2\sin(-x)\\
\amp =\amp -x+2\sin(x)\\
\amp =\amp -(x-2\sin(x))=-s(x)
\end{array}</me>          
          so it has 180-degree rotational symmetry about the origin.
          </p>
        
        <p> (b) 
          The derivative is
          <m>s'(x)=1-2\cos(x)</m>. This is always defined, so there are no critical points from undefined derivatives. 
          So we only need to solve <m>s'(x)=0</m> to find critical points.
          <me> \begin{array}{rcl}
 0 \amp =\amp  1-2\cos(x)  \\
  \cos(x)\amp = \amp \tfrac12 \\
  x \amp= \amp\tfrac{-5\pi}{3}, \tfrac{-\pi}{3}, \tfrac{\pi}{3}, \tfrac{5\pi}{3}
\end{array} </me> 
</p>
  <p> Note that the symmetry of the function means that the critical points are symmetric about the origin, 
    and the behavior on <m>[-2\pi,0]</m> is a mirror image of the behavior on <m>[0,2\pi]</m>.
  </p> 
  <p> Choosing test points in each interval determined by the critical points gives the following sign chart for <m>s'(x)</m>:</p>
  <me> \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    x \amp \text{Sign of } s'(x) \amp \text{Behavior of } s(x) \\
    \hline
    -2\pi \amp (-) \amp \text{decreasing} \\
    -\tfrac{5\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    -\pi \amp (+) \amp \text{increasing} \\
    -\tfrac{\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    0 \amp (-) \amp \text{decreasing} \\
    \tfrac{\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    \pi \amp (+) \amp \text{increasing} \\
    \tfrac{5\pi}{3} \amp 0 \amp  \\
    2\pi \amp (-) \amp \text{decreasing}
  \end{array}
</me>
<p> So the function is decreasing on <m>[-2\pi,-\tfrac{5\pi}{3}) \cup (-\tfrac{\pi}{3},\tfrac{\pi}{3}) \cup (\tfrac{5\pi}{3},2\pi]</m>, 
  and increasing on <m>(-\tfrac{5\pi}{3},-\tfrac{\pi}{3}) \cup (\tfrac{\pi}{3},\tfrac{5\pi}{3})</m>. </p>

  <p> Again we could have used the symmetry of the function to reduce our work. 
    For instance, we could have just analyzed the behavior on <m>[0,2\pi]</m> and then used symmetry to get the rest of our conclusion. </p>

    <p>(c) The second derivative is <m>s''(x)=2\sin(x)</m>, which is defined everywhere, so there are no inflection points from undefined derivatives.
         To find inflection points, we solve <m>s''(x)=0</m>, which gives <m>\sin(x)=0</m>.
         This happens at <m>x= -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi</m>. Because <m> x=-2\pi</m> and <m>x=2\pi</m> are endpoints of the interval, 
         they cannot be inflection points, so the only possible inflection points are at <m>x=-\pi,0,\pi</m>.
    </p>
    <p> To determine intervals of concavity, we can use test points in each interval determined by the possible inflection points.
      This gives the following sign chart for <m>s''(x)</m>:</p>
  <me> \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    x \amp \text{Sign of } s''(x) \amp \text{Concavity of } s(x) \\
    \hline
    -2\pi \amp 0 \amp  \\
    -\tfrac{3\pi}{2} \amp (+) \amp \text{concave up} \\
    -\pi \amp 0 \amp  \\
    -\tfrac{\pi}{2} \amp (-) \amp \text{concave down} \\
    0 \amp 0 \amp  \\
    \tfrac{\pi}{2} \amp (+) \amp \text{concave up} \\
    \pi \amp 0 \amp   \\
    \tfrac{3\pi}{2} \amp (-) \amp \text{concave down} \\
    2\pi \amp 0 \amp  
  \end{array}
</me>
<p> So the function is concave up on <m>(-2\pi,-\pi) \cup (0,\pi)</m> and concave down on <m>(-\pi,0) \cup (\pi,2\pi)</m>. </p>
<p> Because the function changes concavity at <m>x=-\pi,0,\pi</m>, these points are indeed inflection points. </p>
    
<p>(d) Combining all of this information, we can sketch the graph of <m>s</m>.
  We know there are no asymptotes, and the function is odd, so we can focus on sketching the portion of the graph on <m>[0,2\pi]</m> 
  and then use symmetry to get the rest of the graph.</p>
  <p> Since we will need to plot all critical points and inflection points, we should compute the function values at these points. 
  </p>
    <me> \begin{array}{c|c|c}
    x \amp s(x) \amp \text{Type of Point} \\
\hline
0 \amp 0 \amp \text{inflection point} \\
\tfrac{\pi}{3} \amp \tfrac{\pi}{3}-\sqrt{3}\approx -0.7  \amp \text{critical point} \\
\pi \amp \pi \amp \text{inflection point} \\
\tfrac{5\pi}{3} \amp \tfrac{5\pi}{3}+\sqrt{3}\approx 6.7 \amp \text{critical point} \\
\end{array}
</me>
  

<p>Plotting these points and using the behavior determined in parts (b) and (c) gives the following sketch of the graph of <m>s</m>:</p>

<shortdescription>
Animated graph of s of x equals x minus 2 sine x. 
The curve has a local minimum near x equals pi over 3 and a local maximum near x equals 5 pi over 3. 
There are inflection points at x equals 0 and x equals pi. 
The graph decreases to the minimum, then increases to the maximum, and changes concavity at the inflection points. The graph is odd, so the 
portion on the left side of the y-axis is a rotationally symmetric image of the portion on the right side, reflected across the origin.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Note that this problem was designed to be completed in a reasonable amount of time on a quiz or exam, 
        so it is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis of the function. For example it did not ask for intercepts, so we did not compute them.
        It also did not ask us to classify critical points as local maxima or minima, so we just identified them as critical points and used 
        the sign of the derivative to determine where the function increases or decreases.

        <p>
          (a) There are no vertical asymptotes, and there is a horizontal asymptotes at <m>y=1</m> and <m>y=0</m>. 
          The y-intercept is at <m>(0,\tfrac{1}{2})</m>, and there are no x-intercepts. 
          The function is neither even nor odd, so there is no symmetry.</p> 

          <p>(b) The derivative is <m>f'(x)=\dfrac{e^{-x}}{(1+e^{-x})^2}</m>, which is defined everywhere, so there are no critical points from undefined derivatives.
          Setting the derivative equal to zero gives <m>e^{-x}=0</m>, which has no solutions, so there are no critical points from <m>f'(x)=0</m> either. 
          So there are no critical points. Choosing any test point in <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, we see that <m>f'(x)>0</m> for all <m>x</m>, 
          so the function is increasing everywhere.</p>

          <p>(c) The second derivative is <m>f''(x)=\dfrac{e^{-x}(e^{-x}-1)}{(1+e^{-x})^3}</m>, which is defined everywhere, 
            so there are no inflection points from undefined derivatives. Setting the second derivative equal to zero gives <m>e^{-x}(e^{-x}-1)=0</m>, 
            which has a solution at <m>x=0</m>. Choosing test points in <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and <m>(0,\infty)</m> shows that the function is concave up on 
            <m>(-\infty,0)</m> and concave down on <m>(0,\infty)</m>, so there is an inflection point at <m>x=0</m>.</p>
            
          <p>(d) Plotting the intercept and inflection point, and using the behavior determined in parts (a)-(c) gives the following sketch of the graph of <m>f</m>:</p>

                    <image>
  <shortdescription>
    Graph of the reciprocal of 1 plus the exponential of negative x. 
    The function is increasing everywhere and has horizontal asymptotes at y equals 1 and y equals 0. 
    There is an inflection point at x equals 0, where the graph changes from concave up to concave down. 
     The graph approaches y equals 0 as x goes to negative infinity and approaches y equals 1 as x goes to positive infinity.

    <title>Some True/False Problems</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Determine whether each statement is true or false and briefly justify your reasoning.
      </p>
    </introduction>


<exercise xml:id="tf-curve2-01">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f'(1)=0</m> and <m>f''(1)&gt;0</m>, then <m>f</m> has a local minimum at <m>x=1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True.</em> This is exactly the conclusion of the Second Derivative Test.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>


  <exercise xml:id="tf-curve2-02">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f'(5)=0</m> and <m>f''(5)=0</m>, then <m>f</m> has neither a local minimum nor a local maximum at <m>x=5</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False.</em> If <m>f''(5)=0</m>, the Second Derivative Test is inconclusive, so we cannot conclude anything about local minima or maxima at <m>x=5</m>. 
        For instance, the function <m>f(x)=(x-5)^4</m> has <m>f'(5)=0</m> and <m>f''(5)=0</m>, but it has a local minimum at <m>x=5</m>.
      </p>

      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False.</em> If <m>f''(c)&lt;0</m>, then the function is concave down at <m>x=c</m>, but it could be increasing, decreasing, or constant at that point. 
        For instance, the function <m>f(x)=-x^2</m> has <m>f''(0)=-2&lt;0</m>, but it is increasing at <m>x=-1</m>.

    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True.</em> If <m>f</m> is odd, then <m>f(-2)=-f(2)</m>. So if there is a local maximum at <m>x=2</m>, then there is a local minimum at <m>x=-2</m>.

      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True.</em> If <m>f</m> is even, then <m>f''(-3)=f''(3)=0</m> and the concavity changes at <m>x=3</m>, so there is an inflection point at <m>x=-3</m>.

        <em>True.</em> If <m>f</m> is even, then <m>f(-x)=f(x)</m>. Differentiating both sides gives <m>-f'(-x)=f'(x)</m>, so <m>f'(-x)=-f'(x)</m>, which means that <m>f'</m> is odd.

      <p>
        <em>True.</em> We have

        <em>True.</em> The derivative is <m>f'(x)=\dfrac{1-\ln x}{x^2}</m>. For <m>x\in(4,6)</m>, we have <m>\ln x&gt;1</m>, so <m>f'(x)&lt;0</m>,

        <em>True.</em> The derivative is <m>f'(x)=\dfrac{1-\ln x}{x^2}</m>, which is defined everywhere on the domain of <m>f</m>,

        Setting the derivative equal to zero gives <m>1-\ln x=0</m>, which has a solution at <m>x=e</m>.

        <em>True.</em> The second derivative is <m>f''(x)=\dfrac{2\ln x-3}{x^3}</m>, which is defined everywhere on the domain of <m>f</m>,

        Setting the second derivative equal to zero gives <m>2\ln x-3=0</m>, which has a solution at <m>x=e^{3/2}</m>. We can check by 
        testing the sign of <m>f''(x)</m> on either side of <m>x=e^{3/2}</m> that it does change signs. 
        For example, <m>f''(1)=\dfrac{2\ln 1-3}{1^3}=-3&lt;0</m> and <m>f''(e^2)=\dfrac{2\ln e^2-3}{(e^2)^3}=\dfrac{4-3}{e^6}=\dfrac{1}{e^6}&gt;0</m>.

      <p>While these True / False problems are good for quickly testing your understanding of the concepts, 
    you should also practice applying these ideas to more complicated and complete problems (like those that appear on WeBWork) 
    and can possibly appear on quizzes and exams.
