    Derivatives tell us the instantaneous rate of change of a function.
    In this section, we connect derivatives to the overall behavior of a graph on an interval.
    The key message is that somewhere between two points, the instantaneous rate of change
    must match the average rate of change.

    <title>Rolle’s Theorem</title>

    <p>
      We begin with a special case where the function starts and ends at the same height.
      In that situation, the graph must have a horizontal tangent somewhere in between.

    then decreases to the same low value at x equals b. Dashed lines mark the maximum height and the common endpoint height.

      <p>
        Since <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>, the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that
        <m>f</m> has an absolute maximum value and an absolute minimum value on <m>[a,b]</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a maximum (or minimum) occurs at an interior point <m>c\in(a,b)</m>,
        then <m>f</m> has a local extremum there. Since <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>c</m>,
        the derivative must satisfy <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If instead both the maximum and minimum occur only at endpoints, then
        the condition <m>f(a)=f(b)</m> forces the maximum value and minimum value to be the same.
        In that case, <m>f</m> must be constant on <m>[a,b]</m>, and therefore <m>f'(x)=0</m>
        for every <m>x\in(a,b)</m>.

        In mathematics, the <em>hypotheses</em> of a theorem are the assumptions (the “if” part),
        and the <em>conclusion</em> is what we deduce from them (the “then” part).
        For Rolle’s Theorem, the hypotheses are continuity on <m>[a,b]</m>,
        differentiability on <m>(a,b)</m>, and the condition <m>f(a)=f(b)</m>.

    <p>
      A physical interpretation can help.
      If <m>f(t)</m> represents the height of a rocket that starts and ends on its launch pad,
      then at some moment the rocket must have zero vertical velocity.
      That is exactly the conclusion <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
    </p>



    <remark xml:id="rem-rolles-necessity">
      <p>
        Each hypothesis matters.
        If a function is not differentiable (for example, it has a corner), then the conclusion can fail.
        A graph can rise and then fall sharply without ever having a well-defined horizontal tangent.

          The function <m>f</m> is a polynomial, so it is continuous on <m>[0,4]</m> and differentiable on <m>(0,4)</m>.
          Also <m>f(0)=3</m> and <m>f(4)=3</m>, so the hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem are satisfied.

          Setting this equal to zero gives <m>x=2</m>, which is in the interval <m>(0,4)</m>.

  <title>Derivatives versus Difference Quotients</title>
  <p> 
  Throughout our theory, the derivative <m>f'(a)</m> has been shadowed by the difference quotient 
  <m>\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</m>, 
  over some interval <m>[a,b]</m>. Numerically, the difference quotient is an approximation to the derivative 
  <m>\frac{df}{dx} \approx \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}</m>, 
  provided <m>\Delta x</m> is small. In physical terms, the difference quotient is the average rate of change of 
  <m>f(x)</m> over <m>x \in [a,b]</m>. Geometrically, in terms of the graph <m>y = f(x)</m>, 
  the difference quotient is the slope of the secant line cutting through the points 
  <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m>.
    </p>

<p>
  Now we come to the basic theorem that connects the derivative of a function with its basic properties. 
  It says that the derivative is somewhere exactly equal to the difference quotient, 
  that is, the slope of one particular tangent line is equal to the slope of the secant line.

        The function <m>g</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>,

          For the second claim, let <m>h(x)=f(x)-g(x)</m>. Then <m>h'(x)=f'(x)-g'(x)=0</m>,
          so by the first claim, <m>h(x)=C</m>, which means <m>f(x)=g(x)+C</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the third claim, from the second claim we have <m>f(x)=g(x)+C</m>.
          Evaluate at <m>x=c</m> to get <m>f(c)=g(c)+C</m>.
          Since <m>f(c)=g(c)</m>, we have <m>C=0</m>, and therefore <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>.

          Explain why there is only one function <m>s(t)</m> that satisfies both conditions.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>s(t)</m> and <m>\widetilde{s}(t)</m> both satisfy the same derivative condition
          <m>s'(t)=\widetilde{s}\,'(t)=v_0-gt</m> and the same initial value <m>s(0)=\widetilde{s}(0)=s_0</m>.
          By the Uniqueness Theorem, if two functions have the same derivative everywhere
          and agree at one point, then they are the same function.
          Therefore <m>\widetilde{s}(t)=s(t)</m> for all times in the interval of interest.

    <remark xml:id="rem-physical-law">
      <p>
        This type of uniqueness matches what we expect in many physical settings:
        if an object is launched in the same way, the model predicts the same motion.
        Later in the course, we will see more examples where derivatives together with initial conditions
        determine a unique function.
