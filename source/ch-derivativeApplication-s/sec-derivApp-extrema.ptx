  <p>
    In many real-world problems, we are not just interested in how a function behaves,
    but in finding its largest or smallest possible values.
    For example, we might want to know the maximum height of a projectile,
    the minimum cost of producing an item, or the highest temperature reached during a day.
    Problems like these lead us to the study of <term>extrema</term>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a function defined on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <term>absolute maximum</term> of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> occurs at a point <m>x=c</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>

    </definition>

    <p>
      The output values <m>f(c)</m> are called the <em>maximum value</em> and <em>minimum value</em> of the function.
      While these values are unique, it is possible for a function to attain the same maximum
      or minimum value at more than one input.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The terms <em>maximum</em>, <em>minimum</em>, and <em>extremum</em> come from Latin.
        Their plural forms are <em>maxima</em>, <em>minima</em>, and <em>extrema</em>.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-extreme-value">
      <title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If a function <m>f</m> is continuous on a closed, finite interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
          then <m>f</m> has at least one absolute maximum and at least one absolute minimum on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <remark>
      <p>
        This theorem does not tell us <em>where</em> the extrema occur, only that they must exist.
        If the function is not continuous or the interval is not closed, absolute extrema may fail to exist.

    <p>
      Absolute extrema describe the highest and lowest points over an entire interval.
      A broader concept focuses only on nearby behavior.

          A <term>local maximum</term> of a function <m>f</m> occurs at <m>x=c</m> if

    <p>
      Intuitively, local maxima correspond to hilltops and local minima correspond to valley bottoms.
      Every absolute maximum or minimum is also a local extremum, but not every local extremum
      is an absolute one.

    <title>Derivatives and Extrema</title>

    <p>
      Calculus provides a powerful tool for locating extrema.
      If a function has a smooth hilltop or valley bottom at an interior point,
      the tangent line there is horizontal.

      <title>First Derivative Test for Extrema</title>

        <p>
          If <m>f</m> has a local maximum or minimum at an interior point <m>x=c</m>
          and <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>c</m>, then
          <m>f'(c)=0</m>.

    <remark>
      <p>
        The converse is not true.
        A point where <m>f'(c)=0</m> need not be a maximum or minimum.

          A <term>critical point</term> (or <term>critical number</term>) of a function <m>f</m>

      Critical points are the only possible locations of local extrema in the interior of an interval.
      Endpoints of the interval must also be considered when searching for absolute extrema.

    <title>A Method for Finding Absolute Extrema</title>

      <title>Finding Absolute Maxima and Minima</title>

    <title>Examples and Common Pitfalls</title>

    <example xml:id="ex-stationary-point">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider <m>f(x)=x^3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We compute <m>f'(x)=3x^2</m>, so the only critical point is <m>x=0</m>.
          However, the graph has no local maximum or minimum at this point.
          Instead, <m>x=0</m> is a <term>stationary point</term> where the function
          briefly levels off before continuing to increase.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-abs-value-extrema">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=|2x^2+2x-1|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The derivative is undefined when the expression inside the absolute value is zero,
          producing corners in the graph.
          These points must be included as critical points, and in fact they correspond
          to the absolute minimum values of the function.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-no-absolute-maximum">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=x^2+\dfrac{1}{(x-1)^2}</m> on <m>[-2,2]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Although <m>f</m> has critical points and endpoint values,
          the function increases without bound near <m>x=1</m>.
          Therefore, <m>f</m> has no absolute maximum on this interval,
          but it does have an absolute minimum.
        </p>
