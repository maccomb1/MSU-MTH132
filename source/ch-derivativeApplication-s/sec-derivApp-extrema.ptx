    In many real-world problems, we are not just interested in how a function behaves,
    but in finding its largest or smallest possible values.
    For example, we might want to know the maximum height of a projectile,
    the minimum cost of producing an item, or the highest temperature reached during a day.
    Problems like these lead us to the study of <term>extrema</term>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a function defined on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <term>absolute maximum</term> of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> occurs at a point <m>x=c</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>
          if
          <m>f(c)\ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x\in[a,b]</m>.

        <p>
          An <term>absolute minimum</term> of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> occurs at a point <m>x=c</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      The output values <m>f(c)</m> are called the <em>maximum value</em> and <em>minimum value</em> of the function. These values are real numbers and unique. 
      However it is possible for a function to attain the same maximum
      or minimum value at more than one input.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The terms <em>maximum</em>, <em>minimum</em>, and <em>extremum</em> come from Latin.
        Their plural forms are <em>maxima</em>, <em>minima</em>, and <em>extrema</em>.

      For example, here is a graph of <m>y=\sin (2x)</m> on the interval <m>[0,\tfrac{3\pi}{2}]</m>

      A smooth wave-shaped graph on the interval from 0 to 3 pi over 2.
      The curve starts at 0, rises to a highest point of 1 at pi over 4,
      decreases through 0 at pi over 2, reaches a lowest point of negative 1
      at 3 pi over 4, then rises again through 0 at pi, reaches another highest
      point of 1 at 5 pi over 4, and finally decreases back to 0 at 3 pi over 2.
      The highest value on the graph is 1 and the lowest value is negative 1,

      A graph defined from x equals negative 1 to x equals 2.
      There is a filled point at negative 1 with y-value 1.
      The curve decreases from that point to a lowest point at 0 with y-value 0.
      From x equals 0, the curve increases smoothly to a filled point at 2 with y-value 4.
      The lowest value on the graph is 0 at x equals 0, and the highest value is 4 at x equals 2.

    <p>So now that we can visualize absolute extrema, the question becomes how can we find them? Especially if we do not have a graph to rely on. But before 
      we get to that though, we need to know when should we even be looking for them. For instance if we were asked to find the absolute maximum 
      of <m>y=x</m> on the interval <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, there is no absolute maximum because the function continues to get bigger and bigger without bound.
      Any real number that you might propose as a maximum can be exceeded by choosing a larger number (remember <m>\infty</m> is not a real number).  
      The next section will give us a powerful tool for determining when absolute extrema are guaranteed to exist.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-EVT">
  <title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
  


    <theorem xml:id="thm-extreme-value">
      <title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If a function <m>f</m> is continuous on a closed, finite interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
          then <m>f</m> has at least one absolute maximum and at least one absolute minimum on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The proof of the Extreme Value Theorem relies on the completeness property of the real numbers.
          Since <m>f</m> is continuous on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>, the set of values <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x\in[a,b]</m> is a bounded subset of the real numbers.
          By the completeness property, this set has a least upper bound (supremum) and a greatest lower bound (infimum).
          The continuity of <m>f</m> ensures that these bounds are actually attained at some points in <m>[a,b]</m>, giving us the absolute maximum and minimum.
          A more rigorous proof can be found in MTH 320 (real analysis), but the key idea is that continuity and the 
          closed interval together guarantee the existence of extrema.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <remark>
      <p>
        This theorem does not tell us <em>where</em> the extrema occur, only that they must exist.
        If the function is not continuous or the interval is not closed, absolute extrema may fail to exist.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p>
      Before moving on let's stop and justify that if a function is not continuous or the interval is not closed, absolute extrema may fail to exist. 
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-no-absolute-maximum">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f(x)=x\</m> on the interval <m>[0,1)\</m>. Argue that this function has no absolute maximum on this interval, even though it is continuous.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x)=x\</m> is continuous on the interval <m>[0,1)</m>, and it takes values that get arbitrarily close to 1 as <m>x\</m> approaches 1 from the left.
          However, since the interval does not include 1, there is no point in the interval where <m>f(x)\</m> actually attains the value of 1.
          Therefore, there is no absolute maximum on this interval, even though the function is continuous. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If we were to say the absolute maximum is 1, then that would be incorrect because <m>f(x)</m> never attains the value 1 on the interval <m>[0,1)</m>. 
                We would be claiming that there is some <m>c\in[0,1)\</m> such that <m>f(c)=1\</m>, but no such <m>c</m> exists.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                And if we were to say that the absolute maximum is some value less than 1 but very close (like 0.9999), then that 
                would also be incorrect because there are values of <m>f(x)</m> that are greater than 0.9999 on the interval <m>[0,1)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          And so the function <m>f(x)=x</m> on the interval <m>[0,1)</m> has no absolute maximum, even though it is continuous.
        </p>
      </solution>

      Intuitively, local maxima correspond to hilltops and local minima correspond to valley bottoms.
      Every absolute maximum or minimum is also a local extremum, but not every local extremum
      is an absolute one.
