  <p>
    In many real-world problems, we are not just interested in how a function behaves,
    but in finding its largest or smallest possible values.
    For example, we might want to know the maximum height of a projectile,
    the minimum cost of producing an item, or the highest temperature reached during a day.
    Problems like these lead us to the study of <term>extrema</term>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be a function defined on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <term>absolute maximum</term> of <m>f</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> occurs at a point <m>x=c</m> in <m>[a,b]</m>
          if

    <p>
      The output values <m>f(c)</m> are called the <em>maximum value</em> and <em>minimum value</em> of the function. These values are real numbers and unique. 
      However it is possible for a function to attain the same maximum
      or minimum value at more than one input.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The terms <em>maximum</em>, <em>minimum</em>, and <em>extremum</em> come from Latin.
        Their plural forms are <em>maxima</em>, <em>minima</em>, and <em>extrema</em>.

      The curve starts at 0, rises to a highest point of 1 at pi over 4,
      decreases through 0 at pi over 2, reaches a lowest point of negative 1

      From x equals 0, the curve increases smoothly to a filled point at 2 with y-value 4.

    <p>So now that we can visualize absolute extrema, the question becomes how can we find them? Especially if we do not have a graph to rely on. But before 
      we get to that though, we need to know when should we even be looking for them. For instance if we were asked to find the absolute maximum 
      of <m>y=x</m> on the interval <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m>, there is no absolute maximum because the function continues to get bigger and bigger without bound.
      Any real number that you might propose as a maximum can be exceeded by choosing a larger number (remember <m>\infty</m> is not a real number).  
      The next section will give us a powerful tool for determining when absolute extrema are guaranteed to exist.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-EVT">
  <title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
  


    <theorem xml:id="thm-extreme-value">
      <title>Extreme Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If a function <m>f</m> is continuous on a closed, finite interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
          then <m>f</m> has at least one absolute maximum and at least one absolute minimum on <m>[a,b]</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The proof of the Extreme Value Theorem relies on the completeness property of the real numbers.
          Since <m>f</m> is continuous on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>, the set of values <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x\in[a,b]</m> is a bounded subset of the real numbers.
          By the completeness property, this set has a least upper bound (supremum) and a greatest lower bound (infimum).
          The continuity of <m>f</m> ensures that these bounds are actually attained at some points in <m>[a,b]</m>, giving us the absolute maximum and minimum.
          A more rigorous proof can be found in MTH 320 (real analysis), but the key idea is that continuity and the 
          closed interval together guarantee the existence of extrema.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

    <remark>
      <p>
        This theorem does not tell us <em>where</em> the extrema occur, only that they must exist.
        If the function is not continuous or the interval is not closed, absolute extrema may fail to exist.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p>
      Before moving on let's stop and justify that if a function is not continuous or the interval is not closed, absolute extrema may fail to exist. 
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-no-absolute-maximum">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f(x)=x</m> on the interval <m>[0,1)</m>. Argue that this function has no absolute maximum on this interval, even though it is continuous.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x)=x</m> is continuous on the interval <m>[0,1)</m>, and it takes values that get arbitrarily close to 1 as <m>x</m> approaches 1 from the left.
          However, since the interval does not include 1, there is no point in the interval where <m>f(x)</m> actually attains the value of 1.
          Therefore, there is no absolute maximum on this interval, even though the function is continuous. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If we were to say the absolute maximum is 1, then that would be incorrect because <m>f(x)</m> never attains the value 1 on the interval <m>[0,1)</m>. 
                We would be claiming that there is some <m>c\in[0,1)</m> such that <m>f(c)=1</m>, but no such <m>c</m> exists.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                And if we were to say that the absolute maximum is some value less than 1 but very close (like 0.9999), then that 
                would also be incorrect because there are values of <m>f(x)</m> that are greater than 0.9999 on the interval <m>[0,1)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          And so the function <m>f(x)=x</m> on the interval <m>[0,1)</m> has no absolute maximum, even though it is continuous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this function does happen to have an absolute minimum of 0 at <m>x=0</m>. Again the extreme value theorem does 
          not guarantee that either a maximum or minimum will exist in this case but they may happen to exist. In this case we have an absolute minimum but no absolute maximum.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex-no-absolute-min">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{-1}{(x-1)^2}</m> on the interval <m>[0,4]</m>. 
          Argue that this function has no absolute minimum on this closed, finite interval <m>[0,4]</m>.

      A graph of a function defined on a finite interval that includes a vertical dashed line
      at x = 1 representing a vertical asymptote. As x approaches 1 from either side,
      the function decreases without bound toward negative infinity.
      To the right, the curve increases and levels off near y = 0.
      A closed point appears at approximately (4, 0), which is the highest point shown
      on the interval. Because the function values decrease without bound near x = 1,
      there is no absolute minimum on the interval, even though an absolute maximum exists.
    </shortdescription>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{-1}{(x-1)^2}</m> is not continuous on the closed interval <m>[0,4]</m>, 
          and it takes values that get arbitrarily close to negative infinity as <m>x</m> approaches 1 from either side.
          However, since the function decreases without bound near <m>x=1</m>, there is no point in the interval where <m>f(x)</m> attains a minimum value.
          Therefore, there is no finite absolute minimum on this interval.
        </p>
        <p> Note that this function does happen to have an absolute maximum of <m>-1/9</m> at <m>x=4</m>. Again the extreme value theorem does 
          not guarantee that either a maximum or minimum will exist in this case but they may happen to exist. In this case we have an absolute maximum but no absolute minimum.
        </p>
      </solution>
      
    </example>


    <p>Before we learn formally how to find absolute extrema, let's take a small detour and 
talk about a related but different concept of local extrema. 
Local extrema are important to understand because they are often easier to find than absolute extrema, 
and they can provide valuable information about the behavior of a function even when absolute extrema do not exist or are difficult to determine.
    </p>

    <title>Local Maxima and Minima</title>

    <p>
      Absolute extrema describe the highest and lowest points over an entire interval.
      A broader concept focuses only on nearby behavior.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-local-extrema">

        <p>

    <p>
      Intuitively, local maxima correspond to hilltops and local minima correspond to valley bottoms.
      Every absolute maximum or minimum is also a local extremum, but not every local extremum
      is an absolute one.

    <title>Derivatives and Extrema</title>



    <p>
      Calculus provides a powerful tool for locating extrema.
      If a function has a smooth hilltop or valley bottom at an interior point,
      the tangent line there is horizontal. 
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-first-derivative-extrema">
      <title>First Derivative Test for Extrema</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> has a local maximum or minimum at an interior point <m>x=c</m>
          and <m>f</m> is differentiable at <m>c</m>, then
          <m>f'(c)=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The converse is not true.
        A point where <m>f'(c)=0</m> need not be a maximum or minimum. For instance, 
        <m>f(x)=x^3</m> has a critical point at <m>x=0</m>, but it is neither a maximum nor a minimum (can verify by graphing or by testing values of <m>f</m> near 0).
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p>So therefore if we are looking for local extrema, we should look for points where the derivative is zero. But what about points where the derivative is undefined?
      These points can also correspond to local extrema, for instance consider the function <m>f(x)=|x|</m> at <m>x=0</m>. The derivative is undefined at this point, but it is clearly a local minimum. 
      This leads us to the concept of critical points.

    <p>
      Critical points are the only possible locations of local extrema in the interior of an interval.
      Endpoints of the interval must also be considered when searching for absolute extrema.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the critical point(s) of <m>f(x)=2x^2+2x-1</m>.

        <p>
          We compute the derivative:
          <m>
            f'(x)=4x+2.
          </m>
          Setting this equal to zero gives us
          <m>
            4x+2=0 \implies x=-\frac{1}{2}.
          </m>
          Since the derivative is defined for all real numbers, there are no points where the derivative is undefined.
          Therefore, the only critical point of <m>f</m> is at <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We compute the derivative using the power rule:

            f'(x)=\frac{2}{3}x^{-\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{2}{3x^{\frac{1}{3}}}.

          Setting this equal to zero gives us

            \frac{2}{3x^{\frac{1}{3}}}=0.

          This equation has no solution because the expression on the left is never zero for any real number <m>x</m>.
          However, the derivative is undefined at <m>x=0</m> because of the negative exponent.

    <title>Finding Absolute Extrema</title>

    <p>So as we have discussed, absolute extrema can only occur at critical points or at endpoints of the interval. Therefore, 
      to find absolute extrema we need to evaluate the function at these points and compare the values. 
      The following strategy summarizes this process.

          We already found the critical point of <m>f(x)=2x^2+2x-1</m> in a previous example: <m>x=-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
          This critical point is in the interval <m>[-3,0]</m>.
          Now we evaluate <m>f</m> at the critical point and at the endpoints:

          f(-3) = 2(-3)^2 + 2(-3) - 1 = 18 - 6 - 1 = 11

          f\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 1 = \frac{1}{2} - 1 - 1 = -\frac{3}{2}

          Both critical points are in the interval <m>[-2,4]</m>.
          Now we evaluate <m>s(t)</m> at the critical points and at the endpoints: </p>
          <me>
            \begin{array}{rcl}
              s(-2) &amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{6}(-2)(8 + 6 - 12) = \frac{1}{6}(-2)(2) = -\frac{2}{3} \\
              s(-1) &amp; = &amp;\frac{1}{6}(-1)(2 + 3 - 12) = \frac{1}{6}(-1)(-7) = \frac{7}{6} \\
              s(2) &amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{6}(2)(16 - 6 - 12) = \frac{1}{6}(2)(-2) = -\frac{4}{6} = -\frac{2}{3} \\
              s(4) &amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{6}(4)(128 - 48 - 12) = \frac{1}{6}(4)(68) = \frac{272}{6} = \frac{136}{3}
            \end{array}
          </me>
          <p>
            Comparing these values, we see that the absolute maximum is <m>\frac{136}{3}</m>, occurring at <m>t=4</m>, and the absolute minimum is <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m>, occurring at both <m>t=-2</m> and <m>t=2</m>.
          </p>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-02">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function that is continuous on an open interval <m>(0,1)</m>
        must have an absolute maximum on that interval.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False.</em> A function that is continuous on an open interval <m>(0,1)</m> is not guaranteed to have an absolute maximum on that interval.
        For example, the function <m>f(x)=x</m> is continuous on the open interval <m>(0,1)</m>, but it does not have an absolute maximum because it approaches 1 as <m>x</m> approaches 1 from the left, but never actually attains the value of 1 on the interval.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-03">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If a function is continuous on <m>[0,1]</m>, then it is guaranteed
        to attain its maximum and minimum values at critical points only.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. If a function is continuous on a closed interval <m>[0,1]</m>, then it is guaranteed to attain its maximum and minimum values 
        on that interval, but these extrema may occur at critical points or at the endpoints of the interval.
        For example, the function <m>f(x)=x^2</m> on the interval <m>[0,1]</m> has an absolute minimum at <m>x=0</m> (an endpoint) and an absolute maximum at 
        <m>x=1</m> (also an endpoint), even though there are no critical points in the interior of the interval.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-04">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If a function has an absolute maximum at <m>x=2</m>,
        then <m>f'(2)=0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. If a function has an absolute maximum at <m>x=2</m>, it does not necessarily mean that <m>f'(2)=0</m>.
        The function could have a sharp peak at <m>x=2</m> where the derivative is undefined, or the maximum could occur at an endpoint of the interval where the derivative does not need to be zero.
        For example, the function <m>f(x)=-|x-2|+3</m> has an absolute maximum of 3 at <m>x=2</m>, but the derivative is undefined at that point due to the sharp peak.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-05">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f'(-5)=0</m>, then <m>f</m> must have either a local maximum
        or local minimum at <m>x=-5</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. If <m>f'(-5)=0</m>, it means that the tangent line to the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>x=-5</m> is horizontal, but this does not necessarily imply that there is a local maximum or minimum at that point.
        The function could have an inflection point at <m>x=-5</m>, where the concavity changes but there is no local extremum.
        For example, the function <m>f(x)=(x-5)^3</m> has a critical point at <m>x=5</m> where the derivative is zero, but it is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>



  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-08">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If a function is not continuous on <m>[3,5]</m>,
        then it cannot have absolute extrema on that interval.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. If a function is not continuous on a closed interval <m>[3,5]</m>, it may still have absolute extrema on that interval.
        The lack of continuity does not necessarily prevent the function from attaining maximum or minimum values.
        For example, the function defined by
        <m>
          f(x) = \begin{cases}
            2 \amp \text{if } x=4 \\
            0 \amp \text{if } x \neq 4
          \end{cases}
        </m>
        is not continuous at <m>x=4</m>, but it has an absolute maximum of 2 at <m>x=4</m> and an absolute minimum of 0 at all other points in the interval.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-09">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A function can have more than one absolute minimum value on a closed interval.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True</em>. A function can have more than one absolute minimum value on a closed interval if it attains the same minimum value at multiple points.
        For example, the function <m>f(x)=\cos(x)</m> on the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m> has an absolute maximum value of 1 at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2\pi</m>, and an absolute minimum value of -1 at <m>x=\pi</m>. 
        In this case, the absolute minimum value of -1 is attained at only one point, but the absolute maximum value of 1 is attained at two different points.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>





  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-16">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>f(x)=x^3-3x</m> has three critical points.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. To find the critical points of the function <m>f(x)=x^3-3x</m>, we first compute its derivative:
        <m>
          f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 = 3(x^2 - 1) = 3(x-1)(x+1).
        </m>
        Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us:
        <m>
          3(x-1)(x+1) = 0 \implies x=1 \text{ or } x=-1.
        </m>
        The derivative is defined for all real numbers, so there are no points where the derivative is undefined.
        Therefore, the critical points of the function are at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>.
        However, we need to check if there are any other critical points. Since the derivative is a quadratic function, it can only have two real roots, which we have already found. 
        Therefore, there are only two critical points, not three. 
      </p>
       </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-17">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>f(x)=x^2</m> on <m>[-2,3]</m>
        has its absolute minimum at an endpoint.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. The function <m>f(x)=x^2</m> on the interval <m>[-2,3]</m> has its absolute minimum at <m>x=0</m>, which is not an endpoint of the interval.
        To see this, we can evaluate the function at the endpoints and at the critical point:
        <me>
          f(-2) = (-2)^2 = 4 \\
          f(0) = 0^2 = 0 \\
          f(3) = 3^2 = 9
        </me>
        Comparing these values, we see that the absolute minimum value is 0, occurring at <m>x=0</m>, which is an interior point of the interval, not an endpoint.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-18">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m> on <m>[0,4]</m>
        has a critical point at <m>x=0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True</em>. To determine if <m>x=0</m> is a critical point of the function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m>, we first compute the derivative:
        <m>
          f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
        </m>
        The derivative is undefined at <m>x=0</m> because it involves division by zero. However, for a point to be a critical point, it must be in the domain of the function. 
        Since <m>x=0</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>, we can consider it a critical point.   
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-19">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x)=2x^2+4x+1</m> on <m>[-5,1]</m>,
        then the absolute maximum occurs at <m>x=1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False</em>. To find the absolute maximum of the function <m>f(x)=2x^2+4x+1</m> on the interval <m>[-5,1]</m>, we first compute its derivative:
        <m>
          f'(x) = 4x + 4 = 4(x + 1).
        </m>
        Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us:
        <m>
          4(x + 1) = 0 \implies x = -1.
        </m>
        The critical point is at <m>x=-1</m>, which is in the interval <m>[-5,1]</m>.
        Now we evaluate the function at the critical point and at the endpoints:
        <me>
          f(-5) = 2(-5)^2 + 4(-5) + 1 = 50 - 20 + 1 = 31 \\
          f(-1) = 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1) + 1 = 2 - 4 + 1 = -1 \\
          f(1) = 2(1)^2 + 4(1) + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7
        </me>
        Comparing these values, we see that the absolute maximum value is <m>31</m>, occurring at <m>x=-5</m>, not at <m>x=1</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-extrema-tf-20">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{(x-2)^2}</m> on <m>[0,4]</m>
        has an absolute minimum on that interval.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
          <em>True</em>. The function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{(x-2)^2}</m> on the interval <m>[0,4]</m> has an absolute minimum of <m>1/4</m> at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=4</m>.
          To see this, we can evaluate the function at the endpoints and based on the graph of the function:
          <me>
            \begin{array}{rcl}
            f(0) \amp = \amp \frac{1}{(0-2)^2} = \frac{1}{4} \\
            f(4) \amp = \amp \frac{1}{(4-2)^2} = \frac{1}{4}
          </me>
          The function has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=2</m>, where the function values increase without bound as <m>x</m> approaches 2 from either side.
          Therefore, the absolute minimum value of the function on the interval <m>[0,4]</m> is <m>1/4</m>, occurring at both endpoints <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=4</m>.      
      </p>
    </solution>
