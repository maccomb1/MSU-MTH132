  <p>
    So far, we have seen how real-world rate-of-change problems and geometric tangent-line problems lead to derivatives.
    In this section, we focus on computing derivatives efficiently by using algebraic rules, so we do not need to return to the limit definition every time.

  <subsection xml:id="derivative-notation">
    <title>Notation for the Derivative</title>

    <p>
      The derivative of a function <m>f</m> can be written in several equivalent ways. In Newton notation we write <m>f'(x)</m>.
      In Leibniz notation we write <m>\displaystyle \frac{df}{dx}</m>, which is meant to remind us of the definition of the derivative as a limit of difference quotients:
    </p>

    <me>
      \displaystyle f'(x)=\frac{df}{dx}=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}.
    </me>

    <p>
      Here <m>\Delta x</m> is a change in the input, and <m>\Delta f</m> is the corresponding change in the output:
      <m>\Delta x=h</m> and <m>\Delta f=f(x+h)-f(x)</m>.
      The notation <m>\displaystyle \frac{df}{dx}</m> does <emph>not</emph> literally mean “a quotient of two tiny numbers.”
      It is a single symbol that represents a limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if <m>f(x)=x^2</m>, then the derivative formula <m>f'(x)=(x^2)'=2x</m> can be written as
    </p>

    <me>
      \displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}(x^2)= 2x.
    </me>

<remark xml:id="rem-derivative-notation">
  <p>
    To emphasize the distinction between the <em>derivative function</em> and the
    <em>derivative at a specific point</em>, we often write
    <m>\displaystyle f'(a)=\left.\frac{df}{dx}\right|_{x=a}</m>.
    This notation highlights that the derivative function is evaluated at
    <m>x=a</m>.
    You may also encounter the notation <m>Df</m> for the derivative of <m>f</m>,
    so that <m>f'(x)=Df(x)</m>.

    <title>Basic Derivatives</title>

    <p>
      The strategy is the same as earlier limit techniques: we establish derivatives of basic functions, then build more complicated derivatives from those.
      The most important basic formulas are the following.
    </p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-constant-and-linear-derivatives">
  <title>Derivatives of Constant and Linear Functions</title>
  <statement>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If <m>f(x) = c</m> is a constant function, then
        <m>\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}(c) = (c)'= 0</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <m>f(x) = x</m>, then
        <m>\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}(x) = (x)'= 1</m>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </statement>
  <proof>
  <p>
    We use the limit definition of the derivative.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, suppose <m>f(x) = c</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant.
    By definition,
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    \frac{d}{dx}(c)
    =
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}.
  </me>

  <p>
    Since <m>f(x+h) = c</m> and <m>f(x) = c</m>, the numerator is zero.
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    \frac{d}{dx}(c)
    =
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c - c}{h}
    =
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0}{h}
    =
    0.
  </me>

  <p>
    Therefore, the derivative of a constant function is zero.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, suppose <m>f(x) = x</m>.
    Using the limit definition,
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    \frac{d}{dx}(x)
    =
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h) - x}{h}.
  </me>

  <p>
    Simplifying the numerator gives
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    \frac{d}{dx}(x)
    =
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h}{h}
    =
    \lim_{h \to 0} 1
    =
    1.
  </me>

  <p>
    Therefore, the derivative of <m>f(x) = x</m> is equal to <m>1</m>.
  </p>

</proof>

<theorem xml:id="thm-power-rule">
  <title>The Power Rule</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>p</m> be any real number for which <m>x^p</m> is defined.
      If <m>f(x) = x^p</m>, then
    </p>
    <me>
      \displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}(x^p) = (x^p)'= p x^{p-1}.
    </me>
  </statement>
<proof>
  <p>
    We begin with a geometric intuition.
    For the function <m>f(x)=x^2</m>, increasing <m>x</m> by a small amount
    <m>h = \Delta x</m> produces a change in area
    <m>\Delta f</m> that is approximately <m>2x\,\Delta x</m>.
  </p>

    <figure xml:id="xSquareProof">
      <caption>
        A geometric illustration of the change in area when a square of side length <m>x</m> is 
        increased by a small amount <m>\Delta x</m>. The added strips show how the area grows 
        approximately like <m>2x\Delta x</m>.
      </caption>
      <image source="images/xSquareDerivProof.png" width="100%">
      <shortdescription>
A square with side length x and area x squared is shown. Light shaded strips of width Delta x 
are added along the top and right sides, representing the increase in area when x is increased by Delta x. 
The diagram visually illustrates how the change in area is approximately proportional to 2x times Delta x.
</shortdescription>
</image>
    </figure>
  </sidebyside>

<p>
    This suggests that
  </p>

  <me>
    f'(x) \approx \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} \approx 2x.
  </me>

  <p>
    A similar idea applies to volume.
    For <m>f(x)=x^3</m>, the change in volume due to a small increase
    <m>\Delta x</m> is approximately <m>3x^2\,\Delta x</m>, </p>
  <sidebyside width="60%">
    <figure xml:id="xCubeProof">
      <caption>
        A geometric illustration of the change in volume when a cube of side length <m>x</m> is increased by a small amount <m>\Delta x</m>. 
        The added slabs show how the volume grows approximately like <m>3x^2\Delta x</m>.
      </caption>
      <image source="images/xCubeDerivProof.png" width="100%">
      <shortdescription>
      A cube with side length x and volume x cubed is shown. Light shaded slabs of thickness 
      Delta x are added to the top, right, and back faces of the cube, representing the 
      increase in volume when x is increased by Delta x. The diagram illustrates that the 
      dominant contribution to the change in volume is proportional to 3x squared times Delta x.

      </image>
    </figure>
  </sidebyside>
    <p> 
    suggesting that <m>f'(x) \approx 3x^2</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    More generally, for the growth of an <m>n</m>-dimensional cube with side length <m>x</m>,
    this geometric reasoning suggests that
    <m>f'(x)=n x^{n-1}</m>.
    While this intuition cannot be visualized for higher dimensions,
    it motivates the algebraic proof that follows.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now prove the Power Rule rigorously using the limit definition of the derivative.
    The constant and linear cases were proved earlier.
    We focus on the case
    <m>f(x)=x^p</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The proof proceeds in stages, beginning with whole number powers.
    Throughout, we repeatedly use the identity
  </p>

  <me>
    a^n - b^n
    =
    (a-b)\big(a^{n-1}+a^{n-2}b+a^{n-3}b^2+\cdots+b^{n-1}\big),
  </me>

  <p>
    which holds for all positive integers <m>n</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Step 1: Positive integer powers.</em>
    Let <m>p=n</m> be a positive integer.
    Using the limit definition of the derivative,
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    \frac{d}{dx}(x^n)
    =
    \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}.
  </me>

  <p>
    Apply the factorization identity with <m>a=x+h</m> and <m>b=x</m>.
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    \frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h}
    =
    \frac{(x+h-x)\big((x+h)^{n-1}+(x+h)^{n-2}x+\cdots+x^{n-1}\big)}{h}
  </me>

  <p>
    Cancel the factor of <m>h</m> to obtain
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    (x+h)^{n-1}+(x+h)^{n-2}x+\cdots+x^{n-1}.
  </me>

  <p>
    Taking the limit as <m>h\to 0</m> gives
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    x^{n-1}+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^{n-1}
    =
    n x^{n-1}.
  </me>

  <p>
    Therefore, for positive integers <m>n</m>,
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    \frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=n x^{n-1}.
  </me>

  <p>
    <em>Step 2: Negative integer powers.</em>
    Let <m>p=-n</m>, where <m>n</m> is a positive integer.
    Then <m>x^p=\frac{1}{x^n}</m>.
    In the derivative limit, we combine fractions and apply the same
    factorization identity with <m>a=x</m> and <m>b=x+h</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    After simplification, the resulting expression reduces to
  </p>

  <me>
    \displaystyle
    -\frac{n x^{n-1}}{x^{2n}}
    =
    (-n)x^{-n-1}.
  </me>

  <p>
    Thus, the Power Rule holds for negative integers as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Step 3: Rational powers.</em>
    Let <m>p=\frac{n}{m}</m>, where <m>m</m> is a positive integer
    and <m>n</m> is any integer.
    Then
  </p>

  <me>
    x^p = x^{n/m} = \sqrt[m]{x^n}.
  </me>

  <p>
    In the derivative limit, the numerator has the form
    <m>\sqrt[m]{(x+h)^n}-\sqrt[m]{x^n}</m>.
    As in earlier work with cube roots,
    we multiply the numerator and denominator by
  </p>

  <me>
    a^{m-1}+a^{m-2}b+\cdots+b^{m-1},
  </me>

  <p>
    where <m>a=\sqrt[m]{(x+h)^n}</m> and <m>b=\sqrt[m]{x^n}</m>.
    This eliminates the radicals and produces the numerator
  </p>

  <me>
    a^m-b^m=(x+h)^n-x^n,
  </me>

  <p>
    which we have already handled.
    Simplifying the resulting limit again yields
    <m>p x^{p-1}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, the Power Rule holds for all rational exponents.
  </p>

  <p>
    The formula
    <m>\frac{d}{dx}(x^p)=p x^{p-1}</m>
    is also valid for irrational exponents such as <m>p=\sqrt{2}</m>,
    but proving this rigorously requires more advanced theory.
  </p>

    <title>Higher Derivatives</title>

    <p>
      Because the derivative of a function is itself a function, we can differentiate again.
      The second derivative of <m>f</m> is denoted <m>f''(x)</m>, and in Leibniz notation it is written
      <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^2f}{dx^2}</m>:
    </p>

    <me>
      \displaystyle f''(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\!\left(f'(x)\right)=\frac{d}{dx}\!\left(\frac{df}{dx}\right)=\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}.
    </me>

    <p>
      If <m>f</m> represents position as a function of time, then <m>f'(t)</m> is <term>velocity</term> and <m>f''(t)</m> is <term>acceleration</term>.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex-higher-derivatives-falling-stone">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A stone falls <m>f(t)=16t^2</m> feet in <m>t</m> seconds. Compute <m>f'(t)</m>, <m>f''(t)</m>, and interpret them.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Differentiate repeatedly using the power rule:
        </p>

        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle f'(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle (16t^2)'
=32t,
\\[0.8em]
\displaystyle f''(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle (32t)'
=32,
\\[0.8em]
\displaystyle f'''(t)
\amp=\amp \displaystyle (32)'
=0.
\end{array}
        </me>

        <p>
          Here <m>f'(t)=32t</m> is velocity (ft/sec), increasing with time.
          The constant <m>f''(t)=32</m> is acceleration (ft/sec<m>^2</m>).
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

<remark xml:id="rem-higher-derivatives">
  <p>
    Higher derivatives are defined by repeatedly differentiating.
    The third derivative of <m>f</m> is denoted <m>f'''(x)</m>,
    the fourth derivative is denoted <m>f^{(4)}(x)</m>,
    and in general the <m>n</m>th derivative is written <m>f^{(n)}(x)</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Leibniz notation, these derivatives are written
    <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^3f}{dx^3}</m>,
    <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^4f}{dx^4}</m>, and
    <m>\displaystyle \frac{d^nf}{dx^n}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the order of the derivative increases, prime notation becomes cumbersome,
    so the superscript notation <m>f^{(n)}(x)</m> is typically preferred for higher derivatives.
