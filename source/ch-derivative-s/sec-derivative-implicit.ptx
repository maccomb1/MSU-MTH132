  <title>Implicit Differentiation</title>

<objectives>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Recognize when a relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> requires implicit differentiation 
      rather than treating <m>y</m> as an explicit function <m>y=f(x)</m>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Differentiate equations that involve both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> by treating <m>y=y(x)</m>, 
      applying the Product Rule, Quotient Rule, and Chain Rule, and then solving for <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}</m>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compute slopes of tangent lines and write equations of tangent lines for curves defined implicitly, 
      including identifying where tangents are horizontal or vertical.
    </li>
  </ul>
</objectives>


  <p>
    In earlier sections, we found tangent lines and rates of change by differentiating functions written in the form
    <m>y=f(x)</m>. However, many important curves are not given as explicit functions of <m>x</m>.
    Instead, they are described by equations that relate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> implicitly.
    In this section, we develop a technique called <emph>implicit differentiation</emph> that allows us to
    compute derivatives directly from such equations.

    <title>A Motivating Example</title>

    <p>
      Consider the circle defined by the equation <m>x^2+y^2=25</m>.
      If we wish to find the slope of the tangent line at the point <m>(3,4)</m>,
      we immediately face a difficulty: there is no function specified in the form <m>y=f(x)</m>.

      A coordinate plane showing the circle defined by x squared plus y squared equals 25.
      The circle is centered at the origin with radius 5.
      A dashed line represents the tangent line at the point (3,4),
      touching the circle at exactly one point.
      The point of tangency is marked, and the tangent line slopes downward to the right.

    <p>
      One possible approach is to make the equation explicit by solving for <m>y</m>. Let's consider this method first
    </p>

<example xml:id="ex-explicit-circle-tangent">

      Find the slope of the tangent line to the circle

    </p>
  </statement>

    <p>
      We begin by solving the equation of the circle for <m>y</m>:

      A coordinate plane showing the circle x squared plus y squared equals 25,
      written explicitly as two functions.
      The upper semicircle is shown as y equals the square root of 25 minus x squared,
      drawn as a solid red curve.
      The lower semicircle is shown as y equals negative the square root of 25 minus x squared,
      drawn as a dotted green curve.
      A dashed blue line represents the tangent line at the point (3,4),
      touching the upper semicircle at that point.
      The upper and lower branches are labeled to emphasize that the circle is not a single function of x.

        </sidebyside>


    <p>
      This shows that the circle is the union of two function graphs. </p>




      <p> 
      Since the point <m>(3,4)</m> lies on the upper semicircle, we use
      <m>y=\sqrt{25-x^2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Differentiate using the Chain Rule:
    </p>

    <me>
      \frac{dy}{dx}
      =
      \frac{d}{dx}(25-x^2)^{1/2}
      =
      \frac12(25-x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x)
      =
      -\frac{x}{\sqrt{25-x^2}}.
    </me>

    <p>
      Evaluating at <m>x=3</m> gives
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac34</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>


<remark xml:id="rem-implicit-motivation">
  <p>
    While solving an equation for <m>y</m> can sometimes allow us to apply standard
    differentiation rules, this approach is often inconvenient and may even be
    impossible. In many equations, even relatively simple ones, such as <m>e^{y}=x+y</m>, the variable <m>y</m>
    appears in multiple locations and cannot be isolated as an explicit function
    of <m>x</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implicit differentiation avoids this difficulty by treating <m>y</m> as a
    function of <m>x</m> and differentiating both sides of the equation directly,
    using the Chain Rule wherever <m>y</m> appears.
  </p>
</remark>



    <p>
      Instead of solving for <m>y</m>, we assume that <m>y=y(x)</m> is an unknown function of <m>x</m>
      that satisfies the equation. Then we can differentiate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>.
    </p>





<example xml:id="ex-implicit-circle-basic">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Use implicit differentiation to find <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}</m> for the circle
      <m>x^2 + y^2 = 25</m>, and determine the slope of the tangent line at the point
      <m>(3,4)</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      We treat <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> and differentiate both sides of the equation
      with respect to <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <me>
      \begin{array}{rcl}
        \dfrac{d}{dx}(x^2 + y^2) &amp;=&amp; \dfrac{d}{dx}(25) \\[0.6em]
        (x^2)' + (y^2)' &amp;=&amp; 0 \\[0.6em]
        2x + 2y\dfrac{dy}{dx} &amp;=&amp; 0.
      \end{array}
    </me>

<remark xml:id="rem-implicit-chain-rule">
  <p>
    The derivative <m>(x^2)' = 2x</m> follows from a basic derivative rule.
    In contrast, differentiating <m>y^2</m> requires the Chain Rule, since
    <m>y</m> is itself a function of <m>x</m>.
    Here the outside function is <m>(\ \ )^2</m> and the inside function is <m>y = y(x)</m>.
    As a result, the derivative introduces the unknown quantity <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}</m>,
    which we can then solve for algebraically.
  </p>
</remark>



    <p>
      We now solve for <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx}</m>.
    </p>

    <me>
      \dfrac{dy}{dx} = -\dfrac{x}{y}.
    </me>

    <p>
      This derivative formula applies to <em>every</em> point on the circle.
      Evaluating at <m>(3,4)</m> gives
    </p>

    <me>
      \left.\dfrac{dy}{dx}\right|_{(3,4)} = -\dfrac{3}{4}.

  Let us now formalize this process into a general technique.

        <p>
          <term>Implicit differentiation</term> consists of differentiating both sides of an equation with respect to <m>x</m>
          and then solving the resulting equation for <m>y'</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the examples and exercises of this section, it is assumed that the given equation determines <m>y</m> implicitly

      <p>
        The key feature is that <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>, even if the equation does not explicitly solve for <m>y</m>.

          2xy + x^2\frac{dy}{dx} + 3y^2\frac{dy}{dx} = 0.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=0</m> at a point on a curve defined implicitly, then the tangent line at that point is horizontal.

    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>True.</em> A slope of zero indicates that the tangent line is horizontal at that point on the curve.

  <exercise xml:id="tf-imp-ap-12">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}</m> is undefined at a point on a curve defined implicitly, then the tangent line at that point is vertical.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <em>False.</em> While an undefined derivative often indicates a vertical tangent line, it can also occur at points where the curve has a cusp or corner.
        Therefore, an undefined derivative does not always imply a vertical tangent line.

          \displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x}{y}.
        </me>
        At points where <m>y=0</m>, the derivative is undefined, indicating a possible vertical tangent line. We must check if 
        such points lie on the curve. Setting <m>y=0</m> in the original equation gives <m>x^2=1</m>, 
        so the points <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m> are on the curve and we can verify with a graph that they have vertical tangents.
