  <p>
    Derivatives begin with a simple question: how fast is something changing <em>right now</em>?
    You already know how to compute an <em>average</em> rate of change over a time interval.
    The derivative is what happens when we shrink that interval smaller and smaller and study the
    limiting behavior of these average rates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this section, the same expression will appear in multiple contexts:
    average velocity, slopes of secant lines, and instantaneous rate of change.
    This expression is called the <em>difference quotient</em>.
  </p>

<subsection xml:id="instantaneous-velocity">
  <title>Average and Instantaneous Velocity</title>

  <p>
    Suppose a particle moves along a line so that at time <m>t</m> it is at position <m>f(t)</m>.
    We begin by defining the average velocity over a time interval.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-average-velocity">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(t)</m> denote the position of an object at time <m>t</m>.
        The <term>average velocity</term> of the object on the time interval
        <m>[a,b]</m> is
      </p>
      <me>
        \displaystyle v_{\mathrm{avg}}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
      </me>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark xml:id="rem-avg-velocity-interpretation">
    <p>
      The average velocity represents the total change in position divided by the total
      change in time. Geometrically, it is the slope of the secant line connecting
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m> on the graph of <m>y=f(t)</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

  <p>
    Instantaneous velocity cannot be measured over a single moment in time.
    Instead, it is defined as a limit of average velocities over shrinking time intervals.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-instantaneous-velocity">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(t)</m> denote the position of an object at time <m>t</m>.
        The <term>instantaneous velocity</term> at time <m>t=a</m> is
      </p>
      <me>
        \displaystyle v=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h},
      </me>
      <p>
        provided this limit exists. More generally, if <m>f(t)</m> represents a quantity other than position,
      this same limit represents the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term>
      of that quantity with respect to time at <m>t = a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <remark xml:id="rem-velocity-speed">
    <p>
      Velocity may be positive or negative depending on direction of motion.
      The <em>speed</em> of an object is the absolute value of its velocity.
    </p>

<example xml:id="ex-falling-stone">
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A stone dropped from a bridge has position (in feet below the bridge)

      <p>
        So the average velocity on <m>[3,4]</m> is <m>112</m> ft/sec.

      <p>
        As <m>h</m> gets smaller, the average velocities get closer to <m>96</m>.
        So a reasonable estimate for the instantaneous velocity at <m>t=3</m> is

      </me>

      <p>
        As we take <m>h</m> smaller and smaller, the error term <m>16h</m> approaches zero, and
the average velocity approaches the limiting value <m>96</m>, which by definition is
the instantaneous velocity.
        Therefore, the instantaneous velocity at <m>t=3</m> is <m>96</m> ft/sec.

  <title>Slopes of Secant Lines and Slopes of Tangent Lines</title>

  <p>
    We have described velocity on several conceptual levels.
    It can be understood as a <em>physical</em> quantity describing motion,
    a <em>numerical</em> approximation obtained from average rates of change,
    and an <em>algebraic</em> computation using limits.
    Velocity also has a <em>geometric</em> interpretation in terms of the graph
    <m>y=f(t)</m>, where it corresponds to the slope of the graph at a given time.
  </p>

  <p>
    A <term>secant line</term> is a line that passes through two distinct points on the graph.
    It cuts across the curve and represents how the function changes between two different
    input values.
    When these two points are far apart, the secant line gives a coarse description of the
    function’s behavior over an interval.

      The slope of the secant line is the slope of the line through the points
      <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m>.
      Algebraically, it is the same formula used for the average rate of change.

  </remark>

  <p>
    A <term>tangent line</term>, on the other hand, touches the graph at a single point and
    matches the direction of the curve at that point.
    It represents the function’s behavior at a specific input value and provides a local,
    instantaneous description of change.

    As the second point used to define a secant line moves closer and closer to the first,
    the secant line approaches the tangent line.

      The limit as <m>h \to 0</m> is the more common definition in practice,

        Using this table, estimate how quickly the weather is warming at <m>x=100</m>
        (Apr 10), in degrees per day.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        To estimate how quickly the temperature is changing at <m>x = 100</m>,
        we approximate the instantaneous rate of change using average rates of change
        from nearby data values in the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, compute the average rate of change from <m>x = 90</m> to <m>x = 100</m>.
      </p>

      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dfrac{T(100) - T(90)}{100 - 90}
&amp; = &amp;
\dfrac{61.0 - 54.1}{10} \\[0.6em]
&amp; = &amp;
\dfrac{6.9}{10} \\[0.6em]
&amp; = &amp;
0.69

      <p>
        Next, compute the average rate of change from <m>x = 100</m> to <m>x = 110</m>.
      </p>

      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\dfrac{T(110) - T(100)}{110 - 100}

\dfrac{67.7 - 61.0}{10} \\[0.6em]

\dfrac{6.7}{10} \\[0.6em]
&amp; = &amp;
0.67

      <p>
        These two values represent average rates of change on either side of
        <m>x = 100</m>.
        Since they are close in value, we use their average to estimate
        the instantaneous rate of change at <m>x = 100</m>.

      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\text{Estimated rate at } x = 100

        Therefore, the temperature is increasing at approximately
        <m>0.68</m> degrees Fahrenheit per day on April 10.
