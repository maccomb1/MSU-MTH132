    <title>Definition of the Derivative</title>

    <p>
      In the last section, we saw that instantaneous velocity can be obtained as a limit of average velocities over
      shorter and shorter time increments. Likewise, the slope of a tangent line can be obtained as a limit of secant
      slopes as the secant point moves closer and closer to the point of tangency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both ideas measure an instantaneous rate of change. For a general function <m>f(x)</m>, we define its instantaneous
      rate of change at <m>x=a</m> using the following limit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here <m>f(a+h)-f(a)</m> is the change in the output, and <m>h</m> is the change in the input.
      The quotient <m>\displaystyle\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}</m> is the average rate of change over the interval
      from <m>a</m> to <m>a+h</m>, and the derivative is the limit as the increment <m>h</m> shrinks to 0.

      A derivative is always a limit of a difference quotient, so direct substitution usually produces the meaningless

  <subsection xml:id="ssec-derivative-fail">
    <title>When the Derivative Fails to Exist</title>

    <p>
      Even if a function is defined at a point, the derivative may fail to exist there. Graphically, this happens when
      the curve does not have a single well-defined tangent line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Common ways differentiability can fail include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Vertical Tangent:</em> slopes become infinite (unbounded).</li>
      <li><em>Corner:</em> the left-hand and right-hand slopes are different.</li>
      <li><em>Discontinuity:</em> if a function is not continuous at a point, then it cannot be differentiable there.</li>
    </ul>

<p>
  We first consider what happens when a function has a vertical tangent.
  Recall that the derivative at a point represents the slope of the tangent line.
  Because vertical lines have undefined slope, the derivative cannot exist at any
  point where the tangent line is vertical.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-derivative-fail-cuberoot">
  <title>A Vertical Tangent</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the function <m>f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}</m>, which we analyzed previously in
      <xref ref="ex-derivative-cuberoot"/>.
      Show that <m>f</m> has a
      vertical tangent at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      From <xref ref="ex-derivative-cuberoot"/>, the derivative of
      <m>f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}</m> is
    </p>

    <me>
      \displaystyle f'(a)=\frac{1}{3(\sqrt[3]{a})^2}.
    </me>

    <p>
      Trying to substitute in <m>a=0</m>, the denominator
      <m>(\sqrt[3]{a})^2</m> yields <m>0</m>, causing the derivative
      <m>f'(x)</m> to grow without bound like we saw in <xref ref="ssec-inf-limits">our section on infinite limits</xref>.
      In other words, the slopes of the tangent lines become arbitrarily large in magnitude.
    </p>

    <p>
      Graphically, this behavior appears as the tangent lines becoming steeper and steeper
      near <m>x=0</m>, eventually approaching a vertical line.
      Since vertical lines have undefined slope, the derivative does not exist at
      <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>


      <figure>
<caption>
  Graph of <m>f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}</m> near <m>x=0</m>, showing a vertical tangent line at the origin

<shortdescription>
  Graph of the cube root function near the origin.
  The curve becomes very steep as it approaches zero.
  A vertical line is drawn at zero to represent the tangent line at that point.
  Because the tangent line is vertical, its slope is undefined and the derivative does not exist there.
</shortdescription>
        </image>
      </figure>

    <p>
      Therefore, <m>f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}</m> is not differentiable at <m>x=0</m>
      due to the presence of a vertical tangent line.
    </p>
  </solution>

<p>
  Next we consider two other common ways differentiability can fail: corners and discontinuities.
  In these situations, it is helpful to introduce <em>right-hand</em> and <em>left-hand</em> derivatives,
  defined using one-sided limits in the same spirit as one-sided limits for functions.
  These allow us to determine whether the derivative exists by comparing the slopes approaching
  a point from the right and from the left.

    <m>f'(a^-)</m> and <m>f'(a^+)</m> exist and satisfy

        The contrapositive is often the useful version in practice:
        if <m>f</m> is not continuous at <m>x=a</m>, then <m>f</m> is not differentiable at <m>x=a</m>.

<p>
  Now that we have studied the main ways a derivative can fail to exist, we will put these ideas together
  and identify the regions where a function is differentiable (that is, where the derivative exists).

  Problems that ask where a function is differentiable often come in two common forms.
  In the first, only a graph is given, with no algebraic expression for the function.
</p>

 <example xml:id="ex-differentiable-intervals-graph">
  <title>Differentiability from a Graph</title>

  <statement>
    <p>
      The graph below represents a function <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      Identify all values of <m>x</m> where <m>f</m> is differentiable. Give your answer in interval notation.

<shortdescription>
  Graph of a piecewise function defined for x greater than negative three
  and less than or equal to five.
  The graph has a sharp corner at x equals negative one.
  There is a jump at x equals zero, with a filled point above and an open point at the origin.
  A vertical dashed line at x equals two indicates another discontinuity.
  Away from these points, the graph is smooth.
</shortdescription>
    </image>
  </figure>

    </p>
  </statement>

  <solution>
    <p>
      A function is differentiable at a point only if it is continuous there
      and has a well-defined tangent line.
      We examine each notable feature of the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <m>x=-1</m>, the graph has a sharp corner.
      The slopes approaching from the left and right are different,
      so the derivative does not exist at this point.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <m>x=0</m>, the graph has a jump discontinuity.
      Because the function is not continuous at <m>x=0</m>,
      it cannot be differentiable there.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <m>x=2</m>, the graph has another discontinuity,
      indicated by the vertical dashed line.
      Since the function does not have a defined value that matches nearby behavior,
      the derivative does not exist at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      On all other intervals where the graph is defined, smooth, and continuous,
      the function is differentiable.
      Therefore, <m>f</m> is differentiable on the intervals
    </p>

    <me>
      (-3,-1)\cup(-1,0)\cup(0,2)\cup(2,5].
    </me>
  </solution>
</example>

<p>
  In the second common type of problem, the function is given by an explicit formula,
  often defined piecewise, and we must use algebraic reasoning to determine where the
  derivative exists.
</p>


  <example xml:id="ex-diff-interval-piecewise">
    <title>Determining Differentiability for a Piecewise Function</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let
      </p>
      <me>
        f(x)=
        \begin{cases}
          x+1, &amp; \text{if } x&lt;0, \\
          |x|, &amp; \text{if } 0\le x&lt;2, \\
          -\frac14x^2+2x-1, &amp; \text{if } x\ge 2.
        \end{cases}
      </me>
      <p>
        Determine where <m>f</m> is differentiable. Give your answer in interval notation.
      </p>
    </statement>

   <solution>
  <p>
    On each open interval where a single formula applies, the function is differentiable:
    <m>x+1</m> is differentiable for <m>x&lt;0</m>, <m>|x|</m> is differentiable for <m>0&lt;x&lt;2</m>,
    and <m>-\frac14x^2+2x-1</m> is differentiable for <m>x&gt;2</m>.
    Therefore, the only points we need to check are the junctions <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    At <m>x=0</m>, we first check continuity:
    for <m>x&lt;0</m>, <m>f(x)=x+1</m>, so <m>\lim_{x\to 0^-}f(x)=1</m>.
    Also <m>f(0)=|0|=0</m>.
    Since <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0^-}f(x)\neq f(0)</m>, the function is not continuous at <m>x=0</m>,
    and therefore it is not differentiable at <m>x=0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    At <m>x=2</m>, we again check continuity:
    for <m>0\le x&lt;2</m>, <m>f(x)=|x|</m>, so <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2^-}f(x)=|2|=2</m>.
    For <m>x\ge 2</m>,
    <m>f(2)=-\frac14(2^2)+2(2)-1=-1+4-1=2</m>.
    Since the left-hand limit equals the function value, <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m>.
    To determine differentiability, we compare one-sided derivatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    The left-hand derivative at <m>x=2</m> is
  </p>
  <me>
    \displaystyle f'(2^-)=\lim_{h\to 0^-}\frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}.
  </me>
  <p>
    For <m>h&lt;0</m> close to 0, we have <m>2+h\in(0,2)</m>, so <m>f(2+h)=|2+h|=2+h</m>.
    Also <m>f(2)=2</m>. Hence
  </p>
  <me>
    \displaystyle f'(2^-)=\lim_{h\to 0^-}\frac{(2+h)-2}{h}
    =\lim_{h\to 0^-}\frac{h}{h}=1.
  </me>

  <p>
    The right-hand derivative at <m>x=2</m> is
  </p>
  <me>
    \displaystyle f'(2^+)=\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}.
  </me>
  <p>
    For <m>h&gt;0</m>, we have <m>2+h\ge 2</m>, so
    <m>f(2+h)=-\frac14(2+h)^2+2(2+h)-1</m>. Using <m>f(2)=2</m>,
  </p>
  <me>
    \displaystyle
    f'(2^+)=\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{-\frac14(2+h)^2+2(2+h)-1-2}{h}.
  </me>
<p>
  Expand the numerator. Since <m>(2+h)^2=4+4h+h^2</m>, we have
</p>

<md>
  <mrow>
    -\frac14(2+h)^2+2(2+h)-3
    = \amp
    -\frac14(4+4h+h^2)+4+2h-3
  </mrow>

  <mrow>
    = \amp
    \left(-1-h-\frac14h^2\right)+1+2h
  </mrow>

  <mrow>
    = \amp
    h-\frac14h^2
  </mrow>
</md>
  <p>
    Therefore,
  </p>
  <me>
    \displaystyle
    f'(2^+)=\lim_{h\to 0^+}\frac{h-\frac14h^2}{h}
    =\lim_{h\to 0^+}\left(1-\frac14h\right)=1.
  </me>

  <p>
    Since <m>f'(2^-)=f'(2^+)=1</m>, the derivative exists at <m>x=2</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Putting everything together, <m>f</m> is differentiable for all real numbers except at <m>x=0</m>.
    In interval notation, <m>f</m> is differentiable on
  </p>
  <me>
    (-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty).
  </me>

  <p> 
  To help us check/visualize here is a graph of the function

      From zero to two, the graph increases linearly.
      For x greater than or equal to two, the graph follows a smooth downward-opening curve.
      The graph highlights points where the function changes behavior and where differentiability must be checked.
