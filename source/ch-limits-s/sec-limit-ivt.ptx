  <p>
    One of the most important applications of continuity is the 
    <term>Intermediate Value Theorem</term> (IVT). 
    This theorem provides a way to guarantee the existence of solutions 
    to equations, even when we cannot solve them exactly. 
    It also explains why continuous functions must pass through 
    all intermediate values between two function outputs.

</theorem>

<remark>
<p>This says that as the function value <m>f(x)</m> goes continuously from 
<m>f(a)</m> to <m>f(b)</m>, perhaps rising and falling many times, it must pass 
through every value <m>r</m> between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.</p>
</remark>

 <p>
    Let's see how the theorem works in practice.
  </p>


<example xml:id="ex-ivt-first">
  <title>Applying the IVT</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Let <m>f(x)=x^3+x-1</m>. Show that there exists a number <m>c\in(0,1)</m> such that <m>f(c)=0</m>.</p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>The function <m>f(x)=x^3+x-1</m> is a polynomial, hence continuous on every interval, in particular on <m>[0,1]</m>.</p>
    <p>Evaluate the endpoints: <m>f(0)=0^3+0-1=-1</m> and <m>f(1)=1^3+1-1=1</m>. Thus <m>f(0)=-1&lt;0&lt;1=f(1)</m>, so the value <m>0</m> lies between <m>f(0)</m> and <m>f(1)</m>.</p>
    <p>By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists <m>c\in(0,1)</m> such that <m>f(c)=0</m>. 
      So although we do not know the exact value of <m>c</m> we know that is must exist and what interval it is in. </p>
  </solution>
</example>

  <p>
    In the previous example, everything worked out neatly: the function was continuous on the interval 
    and the target value fell between the two endpoint values. But if continuity is broken, 
    the Intermediate Value Theorem no longer applies. The next example illustrates this.
  </p>

<example xml:id="ex-ivt-rational">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the function:     
    <m>
      \quad f(x) = \dfrac{x-1}{x-5}
    </m>
    </p>
    <ol marker="(a)">
      <li>Does <m>f(x)</m> take on the value <m>2</m> somewhere in the interval <m>[1,6]</m>?</li>
      <li>Can the Intermediate Value Theorem be applied to justify your answer to (a)? Why or why not?</li>
    </ol>
  </statement>




  <solution>
    <ol marker="(a)">
      <li>
        <p>
          Solve <m>f(x)=2</m>:
        </p>
        <p></p>
  
        <m>
          \begin{align*}
          \dfrac{x-1}{x-5} \amp = 2 \\
          \Longrightarrow\quad x-1 \amp = 2(x-5) \\
          \Longrightarrow\quad x-1 \amp = 2x-10 \\
           x \amp = 9.
        \end{align*}
        </m>
      
 
        <p>
          Since <m>9 \notin [1,6]</m>, the equation <m>f(x)=2</m> has no solution in <m>[1,6]</m>. So <alert>No</alert>, <m>f(x)</m> does not take the value <m>2</m> on <m>[1,6]</m>.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <alert>No</alert> — the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) requires continuity on a closed interval. 
          The function <m>f</m> is not continuous on <m>[1,6]</m> because it has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=5</m> (the denominator is zero there).
        </p>
        <p>
          So even though <m>f(1)=0</m> and <m>f(6)=5</m>, and the value <m>2</m> lies between <m>0</m> and <m>5</m>,
          because <m>f(x)</m> is not continuous on the entire interval <m>[1,6]</m> the Intermediate Value Theorem cannot be applied.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </solution>
</example>


  <p>
    Finally, let's look at a famous equation where the IVT guarantees the existence of a solution, 
    even though we cannot solve it with algebra alone.
  </p>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>Show that there exists a solution <m>x=c</m> to the equation 
    <m>\cos(x)=x</m>.</p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      There is no simple algebraic way to solve <m>\cos(x)=x</m> directly. 
      Instead, define a new function 
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) = \cos(x) - x.
    </me>
    <p>
      Then solving <m>\cos(x)=x</m> is equivalent to finding a root of <m>f(x)</m>, 
      that is, some <m>c</m> with <m>f(c)=0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      First check some values of <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[0,\pi]</m>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><m>f(0) = \cos(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 &gt; 0</m>.</li>
      <li><m>f(\pi) = \cos(\pi) - \pi = -1 - \pi &lt; 0</m>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thus, <m>f(0) &gt; 0</m> and <m>f(\pi) &lt; 0</m>, so the function values 
      change sign between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=\pi</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, recall that <m>f(x) = \cos(x) - x</m> is continuous: 
      the cosine function is continuous everywhere, and <m>x</m> is also continuous, 
      so their difference is continuous.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the Intermediate Value Theorem, if a continuous function takes on values of 
      opposite signs at the endpoints of an interval, then it must equal zero 
      for some number between those endpoints. Therefore, there exists 
      <m>c \in (0,\pi)</m> such that <m>f(c)=0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other words, there is some number <m>c</m> with 
      <m>\cos(c) = c</m>. (In fact, numerically <m>c \approx 0.739</m>, 
      but the IVT only guarantees existence, not the exact value.)
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>


<p>
  The Intermediate Value Theorem is powerful because it guarantees the existence of solutions 
  even when we cannot compute them exactly. Without needing advanced tools or calculators, 
  we can still be certain that roots and crossing points must lie within specific intervals — 
  giving us both confidence and direction in solving problems that might otherwise feel impossible.

        Use the IVT to prove that the equation <m>x^3-7x+5=0</m> has a solution in the interval <m>(0,2)</m>.
      </p></statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=x^3-7x+5</m> (continuous). Compute <m>f(0)=5&gt;0</m> and <m>f(2)=8-14+5=-1&lt;0</m>. Since 0 lies between these values, the IVT guarantees a root <m>c\in(0,2)</m>.

      </p></statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>f</m> is not defined at <m>x=0</m> and hence not continuous on the closed interval <m>[-1,1]</m>. The IVT requires continuity on the entire interval.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement><p>
        A function <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[0,5]</m>, with <m>f(0)=-2</m> and <m>f(5)=7</m>. Use the IVT to explain why <m>f(x)=3</m> must have a solution in <m>(0,5)</m>.
      </p></statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since <m>3</m> lies between <m>-2</m> and <m>7</m>, and <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[0,5]</m>, the IVT guarantees <m>c\in(0,5)</m> with <m>f(c)=3</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement><p>
        Suppose a car's speed (a continuous function of time) was 40 mph at 2:00 pm and 65 mph at 2:10 pm. Explain, using the IVT, why there must have been a time when the car's speed was exactly 55 mph.
      </p></statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>v(t)</m> be speed, continuous on <m>[2{:}00,2{:}10]</m>. Since <m>55</m> lies between <m>40</m> and <m>65</m>, the IVT implies some time <m>c</m> in that interval with <m>v(c)=55</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </exercise>

    <exercise>
      <statement><p>
        Why does the IVT not apply to the function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}</m> on <m>[0,2]</m>, even though <m>f(0)=1</m> and <m>f(2)=3</m>?
      </p></statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The given formula is undefined at <m>x=1</m> (removable discontinuity), so the function is not continuous on the entire closed interval <m>[0,2]</m>. 
          Thus the hypotheses of the IVT are not met.
