<remark>
<p>This says that as the function value <m>f(x)</m> goes continuously from 
<m>f(a)</m> to <m>f(b)</m>, perhaps rising and falling many times, it must pass 
through every value <m>r</m> between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.</p>
</remark>

<example xml:id="ex-ivt-first">
  <title>Applying the Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
  <statement>
    <p>Let <m>f(x)=x^3+x-1</m>. Show that there exists a number <m>c\in(0,1)</m> such that <m>f(c)=0</m>.</p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>The function <m>f(x)=x^3+x-1</m> is a polynomial, hence continuous on every interval, in particular on <m>[0,1]</m>.</p>
    <p>Evaluate the endpoints: <m>f(0)=0^3+0-1=-1</m> and <m>f(1)=1^3+1-1=1</m>. Thus <m>f(0)=-1&lt;0&lt;1=f(1)</m>, so the value <m>0</m> lies between <m>f(0)</m> and <m>f(1)</m>.</p>
    <p>By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists <m>c\in(0,1)</m> such that <m>f(c)=0</m>. 
      So although we do not know the exact value of <m>c</m> we know that is must exist and what interval it is in. </p>
  </solution>
</example>


<p>Note that this is <alert>not</alert> necessarily true for a discontinuous function like 
<m>g(x)</m> in the graph above: taking <m>[a,b]=[2,4]</m>, we have 
<m>g(2)\approx 1.7</m>, <m>g(4)\approx 11.2</m>, and <m>g(2)&lt;7&lt;g(4)</m>, but 
there is a vertical asymptote discontinuity at <m>t=3</m>, and there is 
<alert>no</alert> <m>c\in (2,4)</m> with <m>g(c)=7</m>.</p>

<p>However, <m>g(x)</m> <alert>is</alert> continuous over the interval <m>[0,1]</m>, 
with <m>g(0)\approx -0.33</m>, <m>g(1)\approx 0.72</m>, and <m>g(0)&lt;0&lt;g(1)</m>, 
so the Theorem says there must be some <m>c\in(0,1)</m> with <m>g(c)=0</m>. 
This is just the <m>x</m>-intercept visible in the graph.</p>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>Show that there exists a solution <m>x=c</m> to the equation 
    <m>\cos(x)=x</m>.</p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>We have no easy way of solving this equation, but writing 
    <m>f(x)=\cos(x)-x</m>, we know that <m>f(0)=1</m>, 
    <m>f(\pi)=-1-\pi</m>, and <m>f(0)&gt;0&gt;f(\pi)</m>. 
    Since <m>f(x)</m> is continuous, the Theorem guarantees some 
    <m>c\in(0,\pi)</m> with <m>f(c)=0</m>, meaning <m>\cos(c)=c</m>.</p>
  </solution>
