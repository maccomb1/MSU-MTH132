      <title>Definition of Limits</title>


<p>
The concept of a limit is one of the cornerstones of calculus. Limits allow us to describe precisely what happens to a function’s values as the input 
approaches a particular number—whether or not the function is even defined at that point. 
They provide the language for defining continuity, derivatives, and integrals, and they help us capture “approaching” behavior that can’t be 
expressed by direct substitution alone. 
Before moving on to more formal ideas, we start with an intuitive definition of a limit.

            <definition xml:id="def-limit-intuitive">
                <title>Limit (intuitive)</title>
                    <statement>
                          <p>
                                Consider a function <m>f(x)</m> and numbers <m>L</m>, <m>a</m>.
                                      Then the <term>limit</term> of <m>f(x)</m> equals <m>L</m> as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>,
                                            in symbols <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L</m>, whenever <m>f(x)</m> can be forced
                                                  arbitrarily close to <m>L</m> by making <m>x</m> sufficiently close to (but not equal to) <m>a</m>. 
                                                        If we cannot make <m>f(x)</m> as close to a single value as we would like as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>,
                                                              then we say that <m>f</m> does not have a limit as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                      </statement>
                                                                        </definition>

  <p>
    That is, <m>f(x)</m> approximates <m>L</m> to within any desired error tolerance,
    for all values of <m>x</m> within some small distance from <m>a</m> (but <m>x \neq a</m>).
    One more way to say it: if we make a table of <m>f(x)</m> for any sample values of <m>x</m> 
    getting closer and closer to <m>a</m> (such as <m>x = a+0.1</m>, <m>a+0.01</m>, etc.),
    then the values of <m>f(x)</m> will get as close as we like to <m>L</m>
    (though they might never quite reach <m>L</m>).

    <p>
       Some limits are easy because we can plug in <m>x = a</m> to get the limiting value 
       <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)</m>, in which case we say <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous</term> at <m>x = a</m>. 
       Graphically, as in the <xref ref="fig-limit-graph">above figure</xref>, this means the curve has no jump or hole at <m>(a, f(a))</m>.

    <solution>
      <p><alert>Full Written Solution:</alert></p>
      <p>
        Since our function <m>f(x) = x^2</m> is continuous around <m>x = 5</m> (we can draw the parabola without lifting our pencil), 
        we can simply plug <m>x = 5</m> into <m>f(x)</m> to get the answer <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 5} x^2 = 25</m>.
      </p>
      <p><alert>More Rigorous Solution:</alert></p>
      <p>
        Algebraically, if <m>x</m> is close enough to <m>5</m>, say <m>x = 5 + h</m> for some small <m>h</m> (close to <m>0</m>), then 
        <me>
        x^2 = (5 + h)^2 = 5^2 + 2(5h) + h^2 = 25 + 10h + h^2
        </me>
        which is forced as close as we like to <m>L = 25</m> if <m>h</m> is small enough to 0 (either positive or negative).

We have seen a few problems where a limit exists, but in fact, as the 2004 movie <em>Mean Girls</em> teaches us, sometimes

  One way this can occur is if <m>f(x)</m> does not approach a single limiting value as <m>x</m> approaches <m>a</m>. 
  In such cases, we declare that the <em>limit does not exist</em>, and the symbol <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m> has no meaning. 
  Now let's see such an example.

  </p>

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Near <m>x = 0</m>, the function cannot be forced close to any single output value. 
        That is, <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \operatorname{sgn}(x) \neq 1</m>, since no matter how close <m>x</m> gets to <m>0</m>, 
        there are some <m>x</m> (namely negative) for which <m>\operatorname{sgn}(x)</m> is far from <m>1</m>; 
        and similarly <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \operatorname{sgn}(x)</m> is not <m>-1</m>, nor <m>0</m>, nor any other value. 
        In such cases, it is most appropriate to simply say <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \operatorname{sgn}(x)</m> does not exist.

<remark>
<p>
An important feature of <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m> is that it does not depend on <m>f(a)</m>, even if <m>f(a)</m> is undefined: 
the limit only notices values of <m>f(x)</m> for <m>x \neq a</m>. As a quick mini example, define <m>g(x) = 1</m> for <m>x \neq 3</m>, and <m>g(3) = 2</m>, having the graph:

<figure xml:id="fig-removable-discontinuity-tikz">

Then <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3} g(x) = 1</m>, since if <m>x</m> is close enough to (but unequal to) <m>3</m>, 
then <m>g(x)</m> is arbitrarily close to <m>L = 1</m> (in fact <m>g(x) = L</m>). 
Again, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x \to 3} g(x) \neq g(3) = 2</m>, and <m>g(x)</m> is not continuous at <m>x = 3</m>.

    <title>One-sided Limits</title>

<p>
Sometimes, the behavior of a function as you approach a point depends on which direction you come from. 
For example, a graph might approach one value when moving in from the left, but a completely different value when coming in from the right like in <xref ref="ex-limit-does-not-exist">Example</xref>. 
</p>

<p>
  And so, let's define another type of limit:

<definition xml:id="def-one-sided-limits">

      denoted <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^{+}} f(x) = L</m>, whenever <m>f(x)</m> can be made arbitrarily close to <m>L</m> 
      by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to (but <em>greater</em> than) <m>a</m>.
      The limit from the left, denoted <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^{-}} f(x) = L</m>, is defined similarly, except with <m>x</m> <em>less</em> than <m>a</m>.

</definition>


<remark xml:id="rmk-one-sided-equality">
  <p>
    If we have the ordinary limit <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L</m>, then the left and right limits must both have the same value <m>L</m>.
    In the <xref ref="ex-limit-continuous">Example</xref> above, we have <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 5^+} x^2 = \lim_{x\to 5^-} x^2 = 5^2</m>.</p>
  <p> 
    However in <xref ref="ex-limit-does-not-exist">Example</xref> we have, <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0^+} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = 1</m> and <m>\lim_{x\to 0^-} \operatorname{sgn}(x) = -1</m>,
    even though <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0} \operatorname{sgn}(x)</m> does not exist.

<p>
  In fact, we can make our first Theorem from this idea

<theorem xml:id="thm-two-sided-iff-one-sided">
  <statement>
    <p>
      For a function <m>f</m> and real number <m>a</m>, the (two-sided) limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. Precisely,

    <p>
      A full proof of this theorem requires the formal <m>\varepsilon</m>–<m>\delta</m> definition of a limit and is beyond the scope of this course. 
      You will encounter this level of rigor in MTH 320, where you will learn how to construct proofs of results like this one from first principles.

<subsection xml:id="ssec-inf-limits">
    <title>Infinite Limits</title>

<p>
Up to this point, most of the limits we’ve encountered have approached a finite number. 
However, some functions behave very differently: as you get closer to certain <m>x</m>-values, the function’s values grow 
without bound—either shooting up toward positive infinity or diving down toward negative infinity. In these cases, 
the function doesn’t have a finite limit, but the way it “blows up” is still predictable.

<definition xml:id="def-infinite-limits">
  <title>Infinite Limits and Vertical Asymptotes</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      We define <term>infinite limits</term> as follows: 
      <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \infty</m> means that <m>f(x)</m> can be made larger than any real number
      (for example, <m>f(x) &gt; 1000</m>) by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to (but not equal to) <m>a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = -\infty</m> means that <m>f(x)</m> can be made smaller than any real number 
      (for example, <m>f(x) &lt; -9547</m>) by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close to (but not equal to) <m>a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such behavior signals a <term>vertical asymptote</term> at <m>x=a</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>

<remark xml:id="rmk-infinity-meaning">
  <p>
    The symbol <m>\infty</m> (and likewise <m>-\infty</m>) has no meaning by itself; it is simply a way of saying that <m>f(x)</m> can be made as large as desired.

              <p>
              Looking at the graph <m>y = \dfrac{1}{|x|}</m>, we can notice two key features near <m>x = 0</m>:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>The graph is in two pieces — one in quadrant II (for <m>x &lt; 0</m>) and one in quadrant I (for <m>x &gt; 0</m>).</li>
                <li>Both pieces shoot straight up as they get close to <m>x = 0</m>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              This means the function grows beyond any large number we can choose when <m>x</m> is close enough to <m>0</m>. 
              And so we know <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)=\infty</m>

            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
              As <m>x</m> gets very close to <m>0</m>, <m>|x|</m> gets very small — like <m>0.1</m>, <m>0.01</m>, <m>0.001</m>, and so on. 
              Dividing <m>1</m> by a very small positive number gives a very large positive number (for example, <m>\frac{1}{0.1} = 10</m>, <m>\frac{1}{0.01} = 100</m>, <m>\frac{1}{0.001} = 1000</m>).
              In general, we can shorthand this fact as <m>\left(\frac 1{\text{tiny}}=\text{huge}\right)</m>.

</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="ssec-locating-va">
  <title>Locating Vertical Asymptotes</title>
  
  <p>
  A vertical asymptote occurs at a value of <m>x</m> where a function grows without bound (positively or negatively) as <m>x</m> approaches that value. 
  This often happens when the function’s formula has a denominator that becomes zero while the numerator stays nonzero, making the function’s value extremely large 
  in magnitude near that point. 
  </p>

  <insight xml:id="strat-locating-va">
    <title>How to Locate Vertical Asymptotes</title>
    
    <p>
      To locate possible vertical asymptotes, we look for values of <m>x</m> that make the denominator zero but do not also make the numerator zero. 
      Once we have these candidates, 
      we check the one-sided limits to determine whether the function increases toward <m>\infty</m> or decreases toward <m>-\infty</m> on each side.
    </p>
  </insight>

  <p>
    Now let's see it in action with an example

          </p>

    </solution>
  </example>

<p>And lastly, a true/false problem on the same subject</p>

<problem xml:id="prob-hole-vs-asymptote">
  <statement>
    <p>
      True or False: The function <m>\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{2x - 2}{x^{2} - 4x + 3} </m> has a vertical asymptote at <m>x = 1</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> Factoring numerator and denominator we get
        <me>
        f(x) \;=\; \frac{2(x-1)}{(x-1)(x-3)} ,
        </me>
        Notice that if we try to naively plug in <m>x=1</m> we get 0 in both the numerator and denominator. From <xref ref="strat-locating-va">Remark</xref>
        we should suspect that this will not yield a vertical asymptote. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          To verify we can plug in numbers close to <m>x=1</m> on either side to see what is happening to <m>f(x)</m>. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \begin{array}{rl}
            f(0.99) \amp \approx -0.995\\
            f(1.01) \amp \approx  -1.005
          \end{array}
        </me>
        <p> 
        From this we suspect <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 1}f(x)= -1</m>. And in fact if we simplify
        <me>
        f(x) = \dfrac{2(x-1)}{(x-1)(x-3)} = \dfrac{2}{x-3}
        </me>
        and then plug in <m>x=1</m> into the simplified function we get <m>\dfrac{2}{1-3} = -1</m>. We will learn in the next section that this will turn out 
        to be a good strategy for evaluating limits. And so, <m>x=1</m> does not yield a vertical asymptote.
