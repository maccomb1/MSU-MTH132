  <subsection xml:id="ssec-defn-continuity">
    <title>Definition and Overview</title>
    <p>
      One of the most basic features of a function is whether it is <term>continuous</term>. 
      Roughly, this means that a small change in <m>x</m> always leads to a fairly small change in <m>f(x)</m>, 
      without instantaneous jumps. In physical terms, the position of a particle moving in space is continuous, 
      but the position displayed in a video could have a gap, making the position function jump discontinuously. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>A function <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous</term> at <m>x=a</m> whenever
        <me>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a).</me></p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
    Graphically, a function is continuous if the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> passes through the point <m>(a,f(a))</m> without any jumps or holes. 
    This matches the intuitive idea of continuity — you can draw the graph near <m>x=a</m> without lifting your pencil.
    </p>

    <p>
      We say <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous on an interval</term> whenever it is continuous at each point of the interval. 
      For endpoints of a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>, we require one-sided limits: 
      <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a)</m> and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to b^-} f(x) = f(b)</m>.
    </p>

    <title>Removable Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has a <term>removable discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if 
          <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x)</m> exists but <m>f(a)</m> is either undefined 
          or does not equal that limit.
        </p>
      </statement>

<p> Graphically, a removable discontinuity appears as a hole in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. 
  The discontinuity is "removable" because we can redefine <m>f(a)</m> to equal the limit, making the function continuous at <m>x=a</m>.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-removable-cancel">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-canceling-zeros"/>. Verify that the function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-4x+4}{x^2-x-2}</m> has a 
      removable discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      At <m>x=2</m>, both the numerator and denominator vanish, giving us the <m>\tfrac00</m> 
      meaningless expression so the function 
      is undefined. However, we can verify again that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x) </m> exists (is equal to <m>0</m>). This matches the definition of a 
      removable discontinuity. Moreover we can view the picture in <xref ref="ex-canceling-zeros"/> to see visually the hole in the graph at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-removable-conjugate">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-conjugate"/>. Verify that this function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x-9}{\sqrt{x}-3}</m> has a 
      removable discontinuity at <m>x=9</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      At <m>x=9</m>, both the numerator and denominator vanish, giving the 
      undefined form <m>\tfrac{0}{0}</m>. However, multiplying numerator and 
      denominator by the conjugate simplifies the expression to <m>\sqrt{x}+3</m>, 
      which is continuous everywhere. Taking the limit, we find
      <me>\lim_{x\to 9}\frac{x-9}{\sqrt{x}-3} = \lim_{x\to 9} (\sqrt{x}+3) = 6.</me>
      Thus, although <m>f(9)</m> is undefined, the limit exists and equals 6. 
      This is exactly the definition of a removable discontinuity, and the graph 
      shows a “hole” at <m>x=9</m>.

    <title>Jump Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has a <term>jump discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if the left and right limits exist but are unequal:
          <me>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x).</me>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p> Graphically, a jump discontinuity appears as a sudden jump in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. </p>


    <figure xml:id="discont-jump">
      <caption>A jump discontinuity where left and right limits differ.</caption>
      <image source="images/1-8-Discont-iii.png" width="60%"/>
    </figure>
    </definition>


<example xml:id="ex-jump-abs-value">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-abs-value"/>. Verify that the function 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{|x^2-4|}{x-2}</m> has a 
      <term>jump discontinuity</term> at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Notice that <m>x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)</m>. For <m>x&gt;2</m>, the absolute value 
      simplifies to <m>|x^2-4|=(x-2)(x+2)</m>, so 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=x+2</m>. For <m>x&lt;2</m>, we instead get 
      <m>|x^2-4|=-(x-2)(x+2)</m>, so 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{-(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=-(x+2)</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the left-hand limit is 
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^-} (-(x+2)) = -4,</me> 
      while the right-hand limit is 
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^+} (x+2) = 4.</me> 
      Since these limits are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist. 
      This confirms that <m>f</m> has a jump discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>

  <subsection>
    <title>Infinite Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has an <term>infinite discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if one or both one-sided limits diverge to infinity:
          <me>\lim_{x\to a^\pm} f(x) = \pm\infty.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <p> Graphically, an infinite discontinuity appears as a vertical asymptote in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. </p>
    <figure xml:id="discont-infinite">
      <caption>A discontinuity caused by a vertical asymptote.</caption>

    </definition>

<example xml:id="ex-infinite-abs">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-inf-lim"/>. Verify that the function 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{|x|}</m> has an 
      <term>infinite discontinuity</term> at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The function <m>f(x)=\tfrac{1}{|x|}</m> is undefined at <m>x=0</m>. 
      As <m>x\to 0^+</m>, <m>|x|=x</m>, so <m>f(x)=\tfrac{1}{x}\to +\infty</m>. 
      As <m>x\to 0^−</m>, <m>|x|=-x</m>, so <m>f(x)=\tfrac{1}{-x}=\tfrac{1}{|x|}\to +\infty</m>. 
      In both directions the function grows beyond all bounds, so
      <me>\lim_{x\to 0} \tfrac{1}{|x|}=+\infty.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <m>f(x)</m> has an infinite discontinuity at <m>x=0</m>. 
      Graphically, this appears as a vertical asymptote along the <m>y</m>-axis.

    <title>Essential Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has an <term>essential discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if one or both one-sided limits fail to exist in any sense. 
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p> Graphically, an essential discontinuity quite often appears as a wild oscillation in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. </p>

<example xml:id="ex-essential-sinx-over-x">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the function <m>f(x)=\sin\!\left(\tfrac{1}{x}\right)</m>. 
      Show that <m>f(x)</m> has an <term>essential discontinuity</term> at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The function is not defined at <m>x=0</m>. As <m>x</m> approaches 0, 
      the reciprocal <m>\tfrac{1}{x}</m> grows without bound in magnitude. 
      Since <m>\sin(\theta)</m> oscillates between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> for all 
      values of <m>\theta</m>, the outputs <m>\sin\!\left(\tfrac{1}{x}\right)</m> 
      continue to oscillate rapidly between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> as 
      <m>x\to 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      No single limiting value can be assigned: the left-hand and right-hand 
      limits both fail to exist because of these wild oscillations. 
      By definition, this is an <term>essential discontinuity</term> at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphically, the curve appears to “wiggle infinitely fast” near the 
      vertical line <m>x=0</m>, matching the intuition for an essential discontinuity.

  </solution>

<remark xml:id="rem-essential-discontinuity-scope">
  <p>
    In this course, students are <emph>not</emph> expected to determine whether
    a function has an essential discontinuity by analyzing its formula alone.
    Identifying essential discontinuities rigorously from an equation requires
    tools from real analysis, which are developed in courses such as
    MTH 320.
  </p>

  <p>
    For MTH 132, essential discontinuities are included primarily so that
    you recognize that they exist and can identify them <emph>from a graph</emph>.
    You will not be asked to classify or prove essential discontinuities using
    algebraic or analytic arguments on quizzes or exams.

  <subsection>
    <title>Continuity of Piecewise Functions</title>
<p>
  For a function defined by cases, whose graph consists of several continuous pieces, 
  the function is continuous provided the pieces join together at the transition 
  points where the cases meet.
</p>


<example xml:id="ex-piecewise-ap">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the piecewise function
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) =
      \begin{cases}
        x^2 - 1 &amp; \text{for } x &lt; 2, \\[6pt]
        kx - 3 &amp; \text{for } x \geq 2.
      \end{cases}
    </me>
    <p>
      Find the value of <m>k</m> that makes <m>f(x)</m> continuous at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      To check continuity at <m>x=2</m>, we need three things: 
      (1) the function is defined at <m>x=2</m>, 
      (2) the limit <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)</m> exists, 
      and (3) the limit equals <m>f(2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, <m>f(2)=k(2)-3=2k-3</m>, so the function is defined at <m>x=2</m> 
      for any value of <m>k</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, compute the one-sided limits. For <m>x\to 2^−</m>, we use the left-hand 
      piece <m>x^2-1</m>:
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^-} (x^2-1) = 2^2-1=3.</me>
      For <m>x\to 2^+</m>, we use the right-hand piece <m>kx-3</m>:
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^+} (kx-3) = 2k-3.</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the limit to exist, these must be equal:
      <me>3 = 2k - 3.</me>
      Solving gives <m>2k=6</m>, so <m>k=3</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, with <m>k=3</m> we have <m>f(2)=3</m>, which matches the limit. 
      Therefore <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m> when <m>k=3</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>




    <example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose a weight is winched from the ground at a constant speed 
      for 8 seconds, is dropped, and lands 2 seconds later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the height <m>s(t)</m> in feet at time <m>t</m> seconds is given by
    </p>
    <me>
      s(t) = 
      \begin{cases}
        vt &amp; \text{for } t \in [0,8), \\[6pt]
        64 - 16(t-8)^2 &amp; \text{for } t \in [8,10].
      \end{cases}
    </me>
    <p>
      How fast should the winch haul upward?
    </p>
  </statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    The function <m>s(t)</m> is defined in two pieces. 
    The first piece, <m>s(t)=vt</m>, describes the weight being lifted upward 
    from the ground at a constant speed <m>v</m> feet per second, for 
    times <m>0 \leq t &lt; 8</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second piece, <m>s(t)=64-16(t-8)^2</m>, describes what happens once the 
    weight is released at <m>t=8</m>. Recall that a dropped object falls 
    <m>16t^2</m> feet in <m>t</m> seconds. Since the fall begins at 
    <m>t=8</m>, we measure the time of fall as <m>(t-8)</m>. 
    Thus, after <m>(t-8)</m> seconds of falling, the weight will have fallen 
    <m>16(t-8)^2</m> feet. The weight was released from a height of 64 feet, 
    so its position after <m>t=8</m> seconds is given by 
    <m>64 - 16(t-8)^2</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To find the correct speed <m>v</m> of the winch, we need the two pieces of 
    the function to “meet up” at <m>t=8</m>. That means the height from the 
    lifting phase at <m>t=8</m> must equal the height from the falling phase 
    at <m>t=8</m>. Using the lifting phase we get <m>s(8)=v\cdot 8</m>. 
    Using the falling phase we get 
    <m>s(8)=64-16(8-8)^2=64</m>. 
    Setting these equal gives
    <me>v \cdot 8 = 64 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad v = \tfrac{64}{8} = 8 \text{ ft/sec}.</me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, let us check continuity explicitly at <m>t=8</m>. 
    From the left-hand side, 
    <me>\lim_{t \to 8^-} s(t) = \lim_{t \to 8^-} vt = 8 \cdot 8 = 64.</me>
    From the right-hand side,
    <me>\lim_{t \to 8^+} s(t) = \lim_{t \to 8^+} \big(64 - 16(t-8)^2\big) = 64.</me>
    Since both one-sided limits equal 64, the two-sided limit exists and equals 64. 
    Moreover, this matches the value of the function at that point, 
    <m>s(8)=64</m>. Therefore the function is continuous at <m>t=8</m>.
  </p>
</solution>

  <subsection>
    <title>Domain of Continuity</title>
    <p>
      Almost all functions defined by formulas are continuous, except at points where they are undefined. This follows from our methods for computing limits.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>Find where <m>g(x)=\dfrac{(x^2-3x+1)\sqrt{x+1}}{x-3}</m> is continuous.</p>
      </statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    First, let’s analyze the rational factor outside the square root. 
    Using the Limit Laws from <xref ref="sec-limit-laws"/> repeatedly, we compute:
  </p>

  <me>
    \lim_{x\to a} \frac{x^2-3x+1}{x-3} 
    = \dfrac{a^2 - 3a + 1}{a - 3},
  </me>

  <p>
    as long as the denominator does not vanish. 
    In other words, this step is valid provided <m>a \neq 3</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, consider the square root factor. 
    By the Limit Laws,
  </p>

  <me>
    \lim_{x\to a} \sqrt{x+1} = \sqrt{a+1},
  </me>

  <p>
    but this only makes sense when the inside of the square root is nonnegative. 
    Thus we require <m>a+1 \geq 0</m>, or equivalently <m>a > -1</m> 
    (strict inequality if we want the square root defined for all nearby <m>x</m>).
  </p>

  <p>
  We now combine the two factors to evaluate the overall limit:
</p>

<me>
  \lim_{x\to a} \dfrac{(x^2 - 3x + 1)\sqrt{x+1}}{x-3}.
</me>

<p>
  By the Limit Laws, the limit of a product equals the product of the limits,
  provided each individual limit exists. So we can separate this into two pieces:
</p>

<me>
  \left(\lim_{x\to a} \dfrac{x^2-3x+1}{x-3}\right)\cdot
  \left(\lim_{x\to a} \sqrt{x+1}\right).
</me>

<p>
  We already computed each factor individually: the rational expression simplifies to
  <m>\dfrac{a^2 - 3a + 1}{a - 3}</m> (valid when <m>a \neq 3</m>), and the square root tends to
  <m>\sqrt{a+1}</m> (valid when <m>a > -1</m>).
</p>

<me>
  \dfrac{(a^2 - 3a + 1)\sqrt{a+1}}{a-3}.
</me>

<p>
  Thus, whenever both conditions (<m>a \neq 3</m> and <m>a > -1</m>) are satisfied,
  this is the value of the limit.
</p>

  <p>Let's now examine the exceptional cases:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>a &lt; -1</m>: The square root <m>\sqrt{x+1}</m> is undefined, 
        so the function is not continuous.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>a = -1</m>: The square root is defined, and since this is the left endpoint 
        of the domain, continuity only requires the right-hand limit. 
        Indeed, <m>\lim_{x \to -1^+} g(x) = g(-1)</m>, so the function is continuous 
        at <m>a=-1</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>a = 3</m>: The denominator vanishes, and the graph has a vertical asymptote. 
        This corresponds to an infinite discontinuity (type (iv)).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Putting this all together, we conclude that <m>g(x)</m> is continuous everywhere 
    in its domain, which consists of the intervals
  </p>

  <me>
    [-1, 3) \cup (3, \infty).
  </me>

  <p>The graph below illustrates this behavior:</p>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Evaluate 
      <me>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 1} \sin\!\left(\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}\right).</me>
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      First, observe that the inside function is 
      <m>g(x)=\dfrac{x^2-1}{x-1}</m>. 
      Direct substitution gives <m>\tfrac{0}{0}</m>, so we simplify:
    </p>

    <me>
      \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} = x+1, \quad x\neq 1.
    </me>

    <p>
      Thus, as <m>x \to 1</m>,
      <me>\lim_{x\to 1} g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1} (x+1) = 2.</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the outer function is <m>f(u)=\sin(u)</m>, which is continuous everywhere, 
      we may apply the Composition Law:
    </p>

    <me>
      \lim_{x\to 1} \sin\!\left(\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}\right) 
      = \sin\!\Big(\lim_{x\to 1} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}\Big)
      = \sin(2).
    </me>

    <p>
      Therefore, the limit is <m>\sin(2)</m>.
    </p>

    <title>Some True/False Problems</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Determine whether each statement is true or false and explain your reasoning
      </p>
    </introduction>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m>, then <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)=f(2)</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution><p><alert>True.</alert> This is exactly the definition of continuity at a point.</p></solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}</m> has a removable discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> At <m>x=2</m>, numerator and denominator both vanish, giving <m>\tfrac{0}{0}</m>. 
    Simplifying, <m>f(x)=x+2</m> for <m>x\neq 2</m>, so <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)=4</m>. 
    Since <m>f(2)</m> is undefined, the discontinuity is removable.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 3^-} f(x)=2</m> and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 3^+} f(x)=5</m>, then <m>f</m> has a jump discontinuity at <m>x=3</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> The left and right limits both exist but are unequal, which is the definition of a jump discontinuity.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x-1}</m> is continuous for all real numbers.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> The function is only defined for <m>x\geq 1</m>. It is continuous on its domain <m>[1,\infty)</m>, but not for all real numbers.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both continuous at <m>x=a</m>, then <m>f+g</m> is also continuous at <m>x=a</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> Can verify using the limit laws and definition of continuity.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The piecewise function <m>f(x)=\begin{cases} x+1 &amp; x&lt;2 \\ 3x-1 &amp; x\geq 2 \end{cases}</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x)=3</m> while <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2^+} f(x)=5</m>. 
    Since the one-sided limits are unequal, the function has a jump discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x)</m> exists, then <m>f</m> must be continuous at <m>x=a</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> Continuity also requires that <m>f(a)</m> is defined and equals the limit. 
    A function can have a removable discontinuity where the limit exists but the function is undefined (or defined to a different value).</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2}</m> has an infinite discontinuity at <m>x=0</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> As <m>x\to 0^\pm</m>, <m>f(x)\to +\infty</m>. 
    The graph has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m>, so this is an infinite discontinuity.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The domain of continuity of <m>f(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{x}}{x-1}</m> is <m>(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>.</p></statement>
 <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> The square root requires <m>x\ge 0</m>, and the denominator excludes <m>x=1</m>. 
    Thus the domain is <m>[0,\infty)\setminus\{1\}</m>. At the endpoint <m>x=0</m>, we have <m>f(0)=0</m> and</p>
    <me>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x-1}=0=f(0).</me>
    <p>So the function is continuous at <m>x=0</m> (one-sided at the endpoint). Therefore the domain of continuity is 
    <m>[0,1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>, not <m>(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)=\infty</m> and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)=-\infty</m>, then <m>f</m> has an essential discontinuity at <m>x=a</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> When one-sided limits are infinite (even if they diverge differently), 
    this is classified as an infinite discontinuity, not an essential discontinuity.</p>
  </solution>
