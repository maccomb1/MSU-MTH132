  <subsection xml:id="ssec-defn-continuity">
    <title>Definition and Overview</title>
    <p>
      One of the most basic features of a function is whether it is <term>continuous</term>. 
      Roughly, this means that a small change in <m>x</m> always leads to a fairly small change in <m>f(x)</m>, 
      without instantaneous jumps. In physical terms, the position of a particle moving in space is continuous, 
      but the position displayed in a video could have a gap, making the position function jump discontinuously. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>A function <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous</term> at <m>x=a</m> whenever
        <me>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = f(a).</me></p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
    Graphically, a function is continuous if the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> passes through the point <m>(a,f(a))</m> without any jumps or holes. 
    This matches the intuitive idea of continuity — you can draw the graph near <m>x=a</m> without lifting your pencil.
    </p>

    <p>
      We say <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous on an interval</term> whenever it is continuous at each point of the interval. 
      For endpoints of a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>, we require one-sided limits: 
      <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x) = f(a)</m> and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to b^-} f(x) = f(b)</m>.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Removable Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has a <term>removable discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if 
          <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x)</m> exists but <m>f(a)</m> is either undefined 
          or does not equal that limit.
        </p>
      </statement>

<p> Graphically, a removable discontinuity appears as a hole in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. 
  The discontinuity is "removable" because we can redefine <m>f(a)</m> to equal the limit, making the function continuous at <m>x=a</m>.
</p>

<example xml:id="ex-removable-cancel">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-canceling-zeros"/>. Verify that the function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-4x+4}{x^2-x-2}</m> has a 
      removable discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      At <m>x=2</m>, both the numerator and denominator vanish, giving us the <m>\tfrac00</m> 
      meaningless expression so the function 
      is undefined. However, we can verify again that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x) </m> exists (is equal to <m>0</m>). This matches the definition of a 
      removable discontinuity. Moreover we can view the picture in <xref ref="ex-canceling-zeros"/> to see visually the hole in the graph at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>

<example xml:id="ex-removable-conjugate">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-conjugate"/>. Verify that this function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x-9}{\sqrt{x}-3}</m> has a 
      removable discontinuity at <m>x=9</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      At <m>x=9</m>, both the numerator and denominator vanish, giving the 
      undefined form <m>\tfrac{0}{0}</m>. However, multiplying numerator and 
      denominator by the conjugate simplifies the expression to <m>\sqrt{x}+3</m>, 
      which is continuous everywhere. Taking the limit, we find
      <me>\lim_{x\to 9}\frac{x-9}{\sqrt{x}-3} = \lim_{x\to 9} (\sqrt{x}+3) = 6.</me>
      Thus, although <m>f(9)</m> is undefined, the limit exists and equals 6. 
      This is exactly the definition of a removable discontinuity, and the graph 
      shows a “hole” at <m>x=9</m>.

    <title>Jump Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has a <term>jump discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if the left and right limits exist but are unequal:
          <me>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x\to a^+} f(x).</me>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p> Graphically, a jump discontinuity appears as a sudden jump in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. </p>


    <figure xml:id="discont-jump">
      <caption>A jump discontinuity where left and right limits differ.</caption>
      <image source="images/1-8-Discont-iii.png" width="60%"/>
    </figure>
    </definition>


<example xml:id="ex-jump-abs-value">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-abs-value"/>. Verify that the function 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{|x^2-4|}{x-2}</m> has a 
      <term>jump discontinuity</term> at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      Notice that <m>x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)</m>. For <m>x&gt;2</m>, the absolute value 
      simplifies to <m>|x^2-4|=(x-2)(x+2)</m>, so 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=x+2</m>. For <m>x&lt;2</m>, we instead get 
      <m>|x^2-4|=-(x-2)(x+2)</m>, so 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{-(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=-(x+2)</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the left-hand limit is 
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^-} (-(x+2)) = -4,</me> 
      while the right-hand limit is 
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^+} (x+2) = 4.</me> 
      Since these limits are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist. 
      This confirms that <m>f</m> has a jump discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>

  <subsection>
    <title>Infinite Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has an <term>infinite discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if one or both one-sided limits diverge to infinity:
          <me>\lim_{x\to a^\pm} f(x) = \pm\infty.</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <p> Graphically, an infinite discontinuity appears as a vertical asymptote in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. </p>
    <figure xml:id="discont-infinite">
      <caption>A discontinuity caused by a vertical asymptote.</caption>
      <image source="images/1-8-Discont-iv.png" width="60%"/>

    </definition>

<example xml:id="ex-infinite-abs">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Revisit <xref ref="ex-inf-lim"/>. Verify that the function 
      <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{|x|}</m> has an 
      <term>infinite discontinuity</term> at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The function <m>f(x)=\tfrac{1}{|x|}</m> is undefined at <m>x=0</m>. 
      As <m>x\to 0^+</m>, <m>|x|=x</m>, so <m>f(x)=\tfrac{1}{x}\to +\infty</m>. 
      As <m>x\to 0^−</m>, <m>|x|=-x</m>, so <m>f(x)=\tfrac{1}{-x}=\tfrac{1}{|x|}\to +\infty</m>. 
      In both directions the function grows beyond all bounds, so
      <me>\lim_{x\to 0} \tfrac{1}{|x|}=+\infty.</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <m>f(x)</m> has an infinite discontinuity at <m>x=0</m>. 
      Graphically, this appears as a vertical asymptote along the <m>y</m>-axis.

    <title>Essential Discontinuity</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function has an <term>essential discontinuity</term> at <m>x=a</m> if one or both one-sided limits fail to exist in any sense. 
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p> Graphically, an essential discontinuity quite often appears as a wild oscillation in the curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>. </p>

  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the function <m>f(x)=\sin\!\left(\tfrac{1}{x}\right)</m>. 
      Show that <m>f(x)</m> has an <term>essential discontinuity</term> at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The function is not defined at <m>x=0</m>. As <m>x</m> approaches 0, 
      the reciprocal <m>\tfrac{1}{x}</m> grows without bound in magnitude. 
      Since <m>\sin(\theta)</m> oscillates between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> for all 
      values of <m>\theta</m>, the outputs <m>\sin\!\left(\tfrac{1}{x}\right)</m> 
      continue to oscillate rapidly between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m> as 
      <m>x\to 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      No single limiting value can be assigned: the left-hand and right-hand 
      limits both fail to exist because of these wild oscillations. 
      By definition, this is an <term>essential discontinuity</term> at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graphically, the curve appears to “wiggle infinitely fast” near the 
      vertical line <m>x=0</m>, matching the intuition for an essential discontinuity.

  <subsection>
    <title>Continuity of Piecewise Functions</title>
<p>
  For a function defined by cases, whose graph consists of several continuous pieces, 
  the function is continuous provided the pieces join together at the transition 
  points where the cases meet.
</p>


<example xml:id="ex-piecewise-ap">
  <statement>
    <p>
      Consider the piecewise function
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) =
      \begin{cases}
        x^2 - 1 &amp; \text{for } x &lt; 2, \\[6pt]
        kx - 3 &amp; \text{for } x \geq 2.
      \end{cases}
    </me>
    <p>
      Find the value of <m>k</m> that makes <m>f(x)</m> continuous at <m>x=2</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      To check continuity at <m>x=2</m>, we need three things: 
      (1) the function is defined at <m>x=2</m>, 
      (2) the limit <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)</m> exists, 
      and (3) the limit equals <m>f(2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, <m>f(2)=k(2)-3=2k-3</m>, so the function is defined at <m>x=2</m> 
      for any value of <m>k</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, compute the one-sided limits. For <m>x\to 2^−</m>, we use the left-hand 
      piece <m>x^2-1</m>:
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^-} (x^2-1) = 2^2-1=3.</me>
      For <m>x\to 2^+</m>, we use the right-hand piece <m>kx-3</m>:
      <me>\lim_{x\to 2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 2^+} (kx-3) = 2k-3.</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the limit to exist, these must be equal:
      <me>3 = 2k - 3.</me>
      Solving gives <m>2k=6</m>, so <m>k=3</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, with <m>k=3</m> we have <m>f(2)=3</m>, which matches the limit. 
      Therefore <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m> when <m>k=3</m>.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>




    <example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Suppose a weight is winched from the ground at a constant speed 
      for 8 seconds, is dropped, and lands 2 seconds later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the height <m>s(t)</m> in feet at time <m>t</m> seconds is given by
    </p>
    <me>
      s(t) = 
      \begin{cases}
        vt &amp; \text{for } t \in [0,8), \\[6pt]
        64 - 16(t-8)^2 &amp; \text{for } t \in [8,10].
      \end{cases}
    </me>
    <p>
      How fast should the winch haul upward?
    </p>
  </statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    The function <m>s(t)</m> is defined in two pieces. 
    The first piece, <m>s(t)=vt</m>, describes the weight being lifted upward 
    from the ground at a constant speed <m>v</m> feet per second, for 
    times <m>0 \leq t &lt; 8</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second piece, <m>s(t)=64-16(t-8)^2</m>, describes what happens once the 
    weight is released at <m>t=8</m>. Recall that a dropped object falls 
    <m>16t^2</m> feet in <m>t</m> seconds. Since the fall begins at 
    <m>t=8</m>, we measure the time of fall as <m>(t-8)</m>. 
    Thus, after <m>(t-8)</m> seconds of falling, the weight will have fallen 
    <m>16(t-8)^2</m> feet. The weight was released from a height of 64 feet, 
    so its position after <m>t=8</m> seconds is given by 
    <m>64 - 16(t-8)^2</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    To find the correct speed <m>v</m> of the winch, we need the two pieces of 
    the function to “meet up” at <m>t=8</m>. That means the height from the 
    lifting phase at <m>t=8</m> must equal the height from the falling phase 
    at <m>t=8</m>. Using the lifting phase we get <m>s(8)=v\cdot 8</m>. 
    Using the falling phase we get 
    <m>s(8)=64-16(8-8)^2=64</m>. 
    Setting these equal gives
    <me>v \cdot 8 = 64 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad v = \tfrac{64}{8} = 8 \text{ ft/sec}.</me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, let us check continuity explicitly at <m>t=8</m>. 
    From the left-hand side, 
    <me>\lim_{t \to 8^-} s(t) = \lim_{t \to 8^-} vt = 8 \cdot 8 = 64.</me>
    From the right-hand side,
    <me>\lim_{t \to 8^+} s(t) = \lim_{t \to 8^+} \big(64 - 16(t-8)^2\big) = 64.</me>
    Since both one-sided limits equal 64, the two-sided limit exists and equals 64. 
    Moreover, this matches the value of the function at that point, 
    <m>s(8)=64</m>. Therefore the function is continuous at <m>t=8</m>.
  </p>
</solution>
    </example>

  <subsection>
    <title>Domain of Continuity</title>
    <p>
      Almost all functions defined by formulas are continuous, except at points where they are undefined. This follows from our methods for computing limits.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>Find where <m>g(x)=\dfrac{(x^2-3x+1)\sqrt{x+1}}{x-3}</m> is continuous.</p>
      </statement>
<solution>
  <p>
    First, let’s analyze the rational factor outside the square root. 
    Using the Limit Laws from <xref ref="sec-limit-laws"/> repeatedly, we compute:
  </p>

  <me>
    \lim_{x\to a} \frac{x^2-3x+1}{x-3} 
    = \dfrac{a^2 - 3a + 1}{a - 3},
  </me>

  <p>
    as long as the denominator does not vanish. 
    In other words, this step is valid provided <m>a \neq 3</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, consider the square root factor. 
    By the Limit Laws,
  </p>

  <me>
    \lim_{x\to a} \sqrt{x+1} = \sqrt{a+1},
  </me>

  <p>
    but this only makes sense when the inside of the square root is nonnegative. 
    Thus we require <m>a+1 \geq 0</m>, or equivalently <m>a > -1</m> 
    (strict inequality if we want the square root defined for all nearby <m>x</m>).
  </p>

  <p>
  We now combine the two factors to evaluate the overall limit:
</p>

<me>
  \lim_{x\to a} \dfrac{(x^2 - 3x + 1)\sqrt{x+1}}{x-3}.
</me>

<p>
  By the Limit Laws, the limit of a product equals the product of the limits,
  provided each individual limit exists. So we can separate this into two pieces:
</p>

<me>
  \left(\lim_{x\to a} \dfrac{x^2-3x+1}{x-3}\right)\cdot
  \left(\lim_{x\to a} \sqrt{x+1}\right).
</me>

<p>
  We already computed each factor individually: the rational expression simplifies to
  <m>\dfrac{a^2 - 3a + 1}{a - 3}</m> (valid when <m>a \neq 3</m>), and the square root tends to
  <m>\sqrt{a+1}</m> (valid when <m>a > -1</m>).
</p>

<me>
  \dfrac{(a^2 - 3a + 1)\sqrt{a+1}}{a-3}.
</me>

<p>
  Thus, whenever both conditions (<m>a \neq 3</m> and <m>a > -1</m>) are satisfied,
  this is the value of the limit.
</p>

  <p>Let’s now examine the exceptional cases:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>a &lt; -1</m>: The square root <m>\sqrt{x+1}</m> is undefined, 
        so the function is not continuous.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>a = -1</m>: The square root is defined, and since this is the left endpoint 
        of the domain, continuity only requires the right-hand limit. 
        Indeed, <m>\lim_{x \to -1^+} g(x) = g(-1)</m>, so the function is continuous 
        at <m>a=-1</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>a = 3</m>: The denominator vanishes, and the graph has a vertical asymptote. 
        This corresponds to an infinite discontinuity (type (iv)).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Putting this all together, we conclude that <m>g(x)</m> is continuous everywhere 
    in its domain, which consists of the intervals
  </p>

  <me>
    [-1, 3) \cup (3, \infty).
  </me>

  <p>The graph below illustrates this behavior:</p>

      \frac{x^2-1}{x-1} = \frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1} = x+1, \quad x\neq 1.
    </me>

    <p>
      Thus, as <m>x \to 1</m>,
      <me>\lim_{x\to 1} g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1} (x+1) = 2.</me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the outer function is <m>f(u)=\sin(u)</m>, which is continuous everywhere, 
      we may apply the Composition Law:
    </p>

    <me>
      \lim_{x\to 1} \sin\!\left(\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}\right) 
      = \sin\!\Big(\lim_{x\to 1} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}\Big)
      = \sin(2).
    </me>

    <p>
      Therefore, the limit is <m>\sin(2)</m>.

    <title>Some True/False Problems</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Determine weather each statement is true or false and explain your reasoning
      </p>
    </introduction>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m>, then <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)=f(2)</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution><p><alert>True.</alert> This is exactly the definition of continuity at a point.</p></solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{x^2-4}{x-2}</m> has a removable discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> At <m>x=2</m>, numerator and denominator both vanish, giving <m>\tfrac{0}{0}</m>. 
    Simplifying, <m>f(x)=x+2</m> for <m>x\neq 2</m>, so <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)=4</m>. 
    Since <m>f(2)</m> is undefined, the discontinuity is removable.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 3^-} f(x)=2</m> and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 3^+} f(x)=5</m>, then <m>f</m> has a jump discontinuity at <m>x=3</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> The left and right limits both exist but are unequal, which is the definition of a jump discontinuity.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x-1}</m> is continuous for all real numbers.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> The function is only defined for <m>x\geq 1</m>. It is continuous on its domain <m>[1,\infty)</m>, but not for all real numbers.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both continuous at <m>x=a</m>, then <m>f+g</m> is also continuous at <m>x=a</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> Can verify using the limit laws and definition of continuity.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The piecewise function <m>f(x)=\begin{cases} x+1 &amp; x&lt;2 \\ 3x-1 &amp; x\geq 2 \end{cases}</m> is continuous at <m>x=2</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x)=3</m> while <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2^+} f(x)=5</m>. 
    Since the one-sided limits are unequal, the function has a jump discontinuity at <m>x=2</m>.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a} f(x)</m> exists, then <m>f</m> must be continuous at <m>x=a</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> Continuity also requires that <m>f(a)</m> is defined and equals the limit. 
    A function can have a removable discontinuity where the limit exists but the function is undefined (or defined to a different value).</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The function <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2}</m> has an infinite discontinuity at <m>x=0</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>True.</alert> As <m>x\to 0^\pm</m>, <m>f(x)\to +\infty</m>. 
    The graph has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m>, so this is an infinite discontinuity.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>The domain of continuity of <m>f(x)=\dfrac{\sqrt{x}}{x-1}</m> is <m>(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>.</p></statement>
 <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> The square root requires <m>x\ge 0</m>, and the denominator excludes <m>x=1</m>. 
    Thus the domain is <m>[0,\infty)\setminus\{1\}</m>. At the endpoint <m>x=0</m>, we have <m>f(0)=0</m> and</p>
    <me>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x-1}=0=f(0).</me>
    <p>So the function is continuous at <m>x=0</m> (one-sided at the endpoint). Therefore the domain of continuity is 
    <m>[0,1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>, not <m>(0,1)\cup(1,\infty)</m>.</p>
  </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
  <statement><p>If <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)=\infty</m> and <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)=-\infty</m>, then <m>f</m> has an essential discontinuity at <m>x=a</m>.</p></statement>
  <solution>
    <p><alert>False.</alert> When one-sided limits are infinite (even if they diverge differently), 
    this is classified as an infinite discontinuity, not an essential discontinuity.</p>
  </solution>
