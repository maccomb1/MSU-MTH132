  <title>Students: How to Use this Book</title>

  <p>Welcome to <c>MTH 132: Calculus I</c>. This book has been created to guide you through the course, to support your in-class learning, and to give you a resource for independent study and practice.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Structure of the Book</title>
    <p>The book is divided into chapters and sections that match the topics of the course. Each section may contain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><term>Definitions</term> of important concepts.</li>
      <li><term>Theorems</term> that summarize key results.</li>
      <li><term>Examples</term> to illustrate ideas and methods.</li>
      <li><term>Exercises</term> for you to practice and check understanding.</li>
      <li><term>Remarks</term> and <term>alerts</term> that highlight common pitfalls or important insights.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>How to Approach Each Section</title>
    <p>Here are some suggestions for making the most of each section:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Before class:</em> Skim the definitions, theorems, and examples. Preview the exercises.</li>
      <li><em>During class:</em> Focus on interactive examples and problem-solving activities with your peers and instructor.</li>
      <li><em>After class:</em> Revisit the examples, complete the exercises, and check solutions or hints when provided.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Exercises and Practice</title>
    <p>Exercises are a central part of learning calculus. You will find:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Conceptual checks</em> to test your understanding of definitions and theorems.</li>
      <li><em>Computational practice</em> to build fluency with calculations and algebraic techniques.</li>
      <li><em>Applications</em> that connect calculus to real-world situations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some exercises will resemble questions on WeBWorK, quizzes, or exams, while others are meant for practice and exploration.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Technology and Tools</title>
    <p>This book makes use of graphs, figures, and sometimes interactive elements (such as Desmos activities). A scientific calculator or graphing tool may be useful, but emphasis is placed on understanding rather than button-pushing.</p>

  <title>Instructors: How to Use this Book</title>

  <p>This text is designed as a teaching resource as well as a student-facing reference for <c>MTH&nbsp;132: Calculus&nbsp;I</c>. It aligns with course goals, departmental pacing, and common assessments (weekly reviews, quizzes, and exams). The notes below suggest ways to integrate sections, examples, and exercises into your teaching while maintaining consistency across the course.</p>

  <section>
    <title>Structure and Organization</title>
    <p>Chapters and sections mirror the course calendar. Within each section you will typically find:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><term>Definitions</term> and <term>Theorems</term> that anchor the core ideas.</li>
      <li><term>Examples</term> that model reasoning, computation, and interpretation.</li>
      <li><term>Exercises</term> spanning conceptual checks, skill practice, and applications.</li>
      <li><term>Remarks</term> and <term>alerts</term> highlighting pitfalls and teaching notes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples and exercises are chosen to build toward the techniques and habits needed for weekly reviews, quizzes, and department-wide exams.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Using the Book in Class</title>
    <p>Consider the following flow for a typical lesson:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Lead with ideas:</em> foreground the main definition/theorem and its intuition before procedures.</li>
      <li><em>Model reasoning:</em> work through one or two examples that showcase setup, algebra, and interpretation.</li>
      <li><em>Guided practice:</em> assign short in-class problems that mirror the modeled examples, with time for pair/group discussion.</li>
      <li><em>Bridge to recitation:</em> point out which exercise sets are best suited for collaborative work later in the week.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Exercises and Assignments</title>
    <p>To promote balance between concepts and skills:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assign a small set of <em>conceptual</em> questions to check understanding of statements and hypotheses.</li>
      <li>Include <em>computational</em> practice to build fluency with standard techniques.</li>
      <li>Add <em>application</em> problems that require interpretation of units, graphs, or real contexts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When curating homework, note which problems align with <c>WeBWorK</c> styles and which resemble quiz or exam formats. Encourage students to write complete solutions (not just final answers) even when checking work with technology.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Technology Integration</title>
    <p>Sections may reference graphing utilities, Desmos activities, or TikZ figures. You might:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preview an interactive graph to build intuition before formal statements.</li>
      <li>Assign a short Desmos exploration as a bridge from reading to practice.</li>
      <li>Demonstrate parameter changes live to connect algebra with geometry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep accessibility in mind: figures include alt text; electronic navigation supports headings and cross-references; printable versions render cleanly.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Supporting Student Learning</title>
    <p>Help students use the text effectively by making expectations explicit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask students to <em>preview</em> the statement-level content (definitions/theorems) before class.</li>
      <li>Direct students to <em>revisit</em> examples after class, comparing their work to the modeled solutions.</li>
      <li>Promote <em>group work</em> in recitations and study sessions, with an emphasis on explaining reasoning aloud.</li>
      <li>Emphasize <em>exact form</em> when appropriate, clear notation, and complete justification.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Assessment Alignment</title>
    <p>To align daily work with assessments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flag examples that are representative of <em>quiz</em> and <em>exam</em> styles.</li>
      <li>Use short “exam-style” problems as exit tickets or warm-ups to normalize expectations.</li>
      <li>Draw review sets directly from section exercise types to make preparation transparent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Coordinate with the course schedule so that key techniques are practiced ahead of common assessments.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Flexibility for Teaching Styles</title>
    <p>The text supports lecture-forward, activity-based, and flipped formats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Lecture-forward:</em> select a minimal set of worked examples and reserve time for guided practice.</li>
      <li><em>Activity-based:</em> invert the order—start with targeted problems, then synthesize with theorems/definitions.</li>
      <li><em>Flipped:</em> assign example videos or reading checks; devote class time to higher-order problems and Q&amp;A.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to supplement with your own contexts or data sets while maintaining alignment with course-wide goals.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Connections to Course Infrastructure</title>
    <p>Use this text alongside other resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><c>D2L</c> for announcements, schedule, and gradebook.</li>
      <li><c>WeBWorK</c> for auto-graded practice aligned with section skills.</li>
      <li>Recitations and weekly reviews for structured collaboration.</li>
      <li>Departmental quizzes and exams for common assessment standards.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Final Notes</title>
    <p>This book provides a shared framework to promote consistency across sections of <c>MTH&nbsp;132</c>. Adapt presentation and examples to your teaching style while keeping core learning goals, notation, and expectations uniform. Model the habits we want students to adopt: show work clearly, use precise language, and interpret results in context.</p>
