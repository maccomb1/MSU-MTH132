  <title>Exponentials</title>


  <p>
    Exponential functions play a central role in calculus and its applications.
    They model growth and decay processes such as population change,
    compound interest, radioactive decay, and cooling.
    In this section, we review the algebraic structure of exponential functions
    and the key properties that will be used repeatedly throughout the course.

    <title>What Is an Exponential Function?</title>

    <definition xml:id="def-exponential-function">
      <title>Exponential Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An <term>exponential function</term> is a function of the form
        </p>
        <me>
          f(x) = a^x,
        </me>
        <p>
          where <m>a &gt; 0</m> and <m>a \neq 1</m> is a constant called the <term>base</term>.

      </statement>
    </definition>

    <remark>
      <p>
        In an exponential function, the variable appears in the exponent.
        This distinguishes exponential functions from power functions such as
        <m>x^3</m>, where the variable is the base.
      </p>
    </remark>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Identify which of the following functions are exponential:
          <m>2^x</m>, <m>x^2</m>, <m>5^{x-1}</m>, <m>x^x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The exponential functions are <m>2^x</m> and <m>5^{x-1}</m>,
          since the variable appears only in the exponent.
          The expressions <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^x</m> are not exponential functions.

    <title>Solving Exponential Equations</title>

    <p>
      Many exponential equations can be solved by rewriting both sides
      with the same base and then equating the exponents.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the equation <m>2^{x+1} = 16</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Rewrite <m>16</m> as a power of 2:
        </p>
        <me>
          16 = 2^4.
        </me>
        <p>
          Then equate exponents:
        </p>
        <me>
          \begin{array}{rcl}
          2^{x+1} &amp; = &amp; 2^4 \\  
          x + 1 &amp; = &amp; 4 \\
            x &amp; = &amp; 3
          \end{array}
        </me>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <remark>
      <p>
        When exponential equations cannot be written with the same base,
        logarithms will be required showcased in the next section.

  <subsection xml:id="ssec-base-e">
    <title>The Natural Base <m>e</m></title>

    <p>
      Among all exponential functions, one base is especially important in calculus:
      the number <m>e</m>, approximately equal to <m>2.718</m>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-natural-exp">
      <title>Natural Exponential Function</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>natural exponential function</term> is defined by
          <m>f(x) = e^x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The function <m>e^x</m> has the special property that its derivative
        is equal to itself.
        Because of this, it is often algebraically simpler to work with
        base <m>e</m> when taking derivatives and integrals.
      </p>
    </remark>

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Rewrite <m>5^x</m> using base <m>e</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We begin by recalling that from <xref ref="ex-precalc-expInv"/>
      natural logarithm and the exponential function
      are inverse functions. In particular, for any positive number <m>A</m>,
    </p>
    <me>
      A = e^{\ln(A)}.
    </me>

    <p>
      Applying this identity with <m>A = 5</m>, we can rewrite the base:
    </p>
    <me>
      5 = e^{\ln(5)}.
    </me>

    <p>
      Now substitute this expression for <m>5</m> into <m>5^x</m>:
    </p>
    <me>
      5^x = \left(e^{\ln(5)}\right)^x.
    </me>

    <p>
      Using the exponent rule <m>(a^x)^y = a^{xy}</m>, we simplify:
    </p>
    <me>
      \left(e^{\ln(5)}\right)^x = e^{x \ln(5)}.
    </me>

    <p>
      Therefore, the exponential function written in terms of base <m>e</m> is
    </p>
    <me>
      5^x = e^{x \ln(5)}.
    </me>

    <p>
      Writing exponentials in this form is especially useful in calculus,
      since derivatives and integrals involving <m>e^x</m> are simpler to compute.
    </p>
  </solution>
