  <title>Inequalities</title>

  <p>
    Inequalities appear throughout calculus, especially when describing domains,
    intervals of increase or decrease, and where functions are positive or negative.
    Unlike equations, inequalities often have many solutions.
    In this section, we focus on a single systematic approach,
    the test point method, which works reliably for many types of inequalities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key idea behind the test point method is simple.
    We first determine where an expression could change sign,
    then test representative points from each interval.
    This approach emphasizes understanding over memorization
    and reduces common algebra mistakes.

    <title>The Test Point Method: Overview</title>

    <p>
      The test point method is used to solve inequalities of the form
      <m>f(x) &gt; 0</m>, <m>f(x) \ge 0</m>, <m>f(x) &lt; 0</m>, or <m>f(x) \le 0</m>.
      Instead of solving directly, we analyze where the function is positive or negative.
    </p>

    <principle xml:id="pr-test-point-method">
      <statement>
        <p>
          To solve an inequality using test points:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Rewrite the inequality so that one side is zero.</li>
          <li>Find all values of <m>x</m> where the expression equals zero or is undefined.</li>
          <li>Use these values to divide the number line into intervals.</li>
          <li>Choose one test point from each interval.</li>
          <li>Determine which intervals satisfy the inequality.</li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </principle>

    <remark>
      <p>
        The test point method works best when the expression is factored.
        This is why factoring is a critical prerequisite for inequalities.

    <title>Several Examples</title>
    <p> Now let's see this modeled in several examples!</p>
    
    <example>
    <title>Linear Example</title>      
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve <m>2x - 4 &gt; 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Step 1: Identify where the expression equals zero.
        </p>
        <me>
          2x - 4 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2.
        </me>

        <p>
          Step 2: Use <m>x = 2</m> to divide the number line into intervals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 3: Test a point from each interval.
        </p>

        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
x = 0: &amp; 2(0) - 4 = -4 &amp; \text{negative} \\
x = 3: &amp; 2(3) - 4 = 2 &amp; \text{positive}
\end{array}
        </me>

        <p>
          Step 4: Choose the interval where the expression is positive.
        </p>

        <p>
          The solution is <m>x &gt; 2</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>


    <example>
    <title>Quadratic Example</title> 
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve <m>x^2 - 5x + 6 \le 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Step 1: Factor the expression.
        </p>
        <me>
          x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3).
        </me>

        <p>
          Step 2: Identify critical points.
        </p>
        <me>
          x = 2, \quad x = 3.
        </me>

        <p>
          Step 3: Test one point in each interval.
        </p>

        <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
x = 0: &amp; (0 - 2)(0 - 3) = (+) &amp; \text{positive} \\
x = 2.5: &amp; (0.5)(-0.5) = (-) &amp; \text{negative} \\
x = 4: &amp; (2)(1) = (+) &amp; \text{positive}
\end{array}
        </me>

        <p>
          Step 4: Include intervals where the expression is zero or negative.
        </p>

        <p>
          The solution is <m>2 \le x \le 3</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>


  <p>
    Rational inequalities require special care because the expression may be undefined
    for certain values of <m>x</m>.
    As we saw in our technique, these values must always be considered when dividing the number line into intervals.
  </p>

  <example>
    <title>Rational Example</title> 
    <statement>
      <p>
        Solve <m>1 - \dfrac{4}{x^2} &gt; 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Step 1: Rewrite the inequality so it is a single rational expression.
      </p>

      <me>
        1 - \dfrac{4}{x^2}
        =
        \dfrac{x^2 - 4}{x^2}.
      </me>

      <p>
        Step 2: Identify where the expression is zero or undefined.
      </p>

      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
x^2 - 4 = 0 &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; x = \pm 2 \\
x^2 = 0 &amp; \Rightarrow &amp; x = 0 \text{ (undefined)}
\end{array}
      </me>

      <p>
        Step 3: Use these values to divide the number line into intervals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The critical points are <m>-2</m>, <m>0</m>, and <m>2</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 4: Choose a test point in each interval.
      </p>

      <me>
\begin{array}{rcl}
x = -3: &amp; \dfrac{9 - 4}{9} = \dfrac{5}{9} &amp; \text{positive} \\
x = -1: &amp; \dfrac{1 - 4}{1} = -3 &amp; \text{negative} \\
x = 1:  &amp; \dfrac{1 - 4}{1} = -3 &amp; \text{negative} \\
x = 3:  &amp; \dfrac{9 - 4}{9} = \dfrac{5}{9} &amp; \text{positive}
\end{array}
      </me>

      <p>
        Step 5: Select intervals where the expression is positive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the inequality is strict, points where the expression equals zero
        are not included.
      </p>

      <p>
        The solution is
      </p>

      <p>
        <m>x &lt; -2</m> or <m>x &gt; 2</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
